Basketball,"When Breanna Stewart, the reigning W.N.B.A. most valuable player, was carried off the floor of the Euroleague championship game in Hungary last weekend with a ruptured Achilles’ tendon, her pain was not just her own.“I love Stewie and was heartbroken to hear about her injury, especially coming off an unbelievable W.N.B.A. season and World Cup,” Elena Delle Donne, the Washington Mystics star and a former league most valuable player, said. “She’s just a great player, competitor and friend. She will be missed this year, but I know she will come back stronger than ever.”Stewart is not only a beloved player for the Seattle Storm; she is also a prominent symbol of an enduring issue in professional women’s basketball in the United States: Its players’ seasons never end.A rookie selected in this month’s W.N.B.A. draft will make $41,265 to $53,537 in base salary, and nobody in the league will earn a base salary of as much as $120,000 this coming season.Because of that, many of the 144 players in the W.N.B.A. maximize their earning window by heading to Europe and Asia, where independent owners, free of salary caps, can offer them lucrative opportunities.There is a price to pay, however: endless seasons bleeding into one another; a physical, psychological and emotional toll; and, the players say, a heightened risk of injury.A few weeks ago, Victoria Vivians, a 2018 first-round pick of the Indiana Fever, tore her anterior cruciate ligament playing in Israel. She, like Stewart, will miss the 2019 W.N.B.A. season.These were only the biggest, latest injuries. Consider one by Amanda Zahui B., the Liberty center, who plays for Sopron Basket in Hungary.“I just twisted my ankle really bad,” she said in a phone interview in the past week. “It’s a swollen potato. But I got to practice through it. We don’t really have the time to take off. Everyone twists their ankles. Everyone gets bone bruises in their knees and such.”All of which elevates the question of how much W.N.B.A. players are paid, and whether a framework can be established to keep more of them in the United States during the league’s off-season.“I’ve always said, everybody that plays overseas in the W.N.B.A. needs therapy,” Mystics guard Kristi Toliver, who spent a decade on the hamster wheel of women’s professional basketball before being hired this off-season as an assistant coach for the N.B.A.’s Washington Wizards, said ahead of her 11th W.N.B.A. campaign. “It’s just a real thing — just so much that you go through with the travel and, being away from loved ones, family or significant others, and trying to manage and deal with all these different things that are coming at you.“But you have a high-level job and you have to perform well in order to keep it.”Ending the financial need for nonstop play is a prime focus of Terri Jackson, president of the Women’s National Basketball Players Association. It appears the league is supportive as well, which is not surprising, given that the quality of play would most likely rise and players who remained in their home market could promote their teams year-round.“I think it’s a dream, a goal, of the union to grow the league to the point where players can work in it year-round and not have to endure the risks and the rigors of overseas play, of that 12-month calendar,” Jackson said. “It’s a matter that concerns me. It’s a matter that is top of mind for the executive committee and our larger C.B.A. committee.”That focus is particularly important right now, after the players’ association opted out of its collective bargaining agreement with the league late last year. So the injury to Stewart, while reflecting a longstanding reality, has also shed new light on the way these players earn a living."
Basketball,"LOS ANGELES — Mick Cronin has been hired as UCLA's basketball coach, ending a months-long search to find a replacement for the fired Steve Alford.The university says Cronin agreed to a $24 million, six-year deal Tuesday.He leaves his alma mater Cincinnati after 16 seasons, having led the Bearcats to the NCAA Tournament in each of the last nine years.The 47-year-old coach will be introduced at a campus news conference Wednesday.Cronin's only other head coaching stint was at Murray State from 2003-06. He was associate head coach at Louisville from 2001-03 and worked as an assistant and video coordinator from 1996 to 2001 at Cincinnati.Alford was fired on Dec. 31.___"
Basketball,"TAMPA, Fla. — Baylor and Notre Dame capped the women's college basketball season with a thrilling championship game.The sport now has had a different champion in the past four years with the Lady Bears edging the Irish 82-81 on Sunday night to win their third title. It's only the second time in the past two decades that there have been that many teams claiming the title.""Just a great game for women's basketball,"" Baylor coach Kim Mulkey said.The 11-point combined differential for the three games in the Final Four was the closest in the history of the tournament, topping last season's 15-point margin. More than 40,000 fans attended the Final Four games, which was the most since 2010. Overall, nearly 275,000 fans attended the entire tournament, which ranks eighth all-time, including 20,127 for the title game. It was the highest attendance in over 15 years for the NCAAs.""We've had a really great championship. Our first- and second-round numbers is the best we've seen in 11 years,"" NCAA vice president for women's basketball Lynn Holzman said.There were a number of competitive games in the entire tournament, including Sunday night's title tilt. During the regular season, the Top 25 was upset and three different teams held the No. 1 spot in the poll, including Baylor, which was the most since 2012.While 12 of the 15 players on the AP All-American teams will not be returning, the future is still bright with plenty of star power coming back.Oregon Ducks junior Sabrina Ionescu announced Saturday night that she was going to return for her senior season. She potentially could have gone to the WNBA this year.Notre Dame guard Jackie Young hasn't revealed her intentions yet. Like Ionescu, the junior turns 22 this year which makes her eligible for the WNBA draft.Baylor forward Lauren Cox will be back at some point next year. She injured her left knee in the title game in the third quarter. Mulkey made it sound like Cox could miss at least some of next season because of the injury.""That kid, if she didn't get hurt, and she will be back, God works in mysterious ways, would have been the No. 1 probably pick in the draft next year,"" Mulkey said. ""That kid probably would have been defensive player of the year nationally next year. That's how good she is. And she will be back, I promise you that. It may take her a year. We'll rest her, do whatever.""______"
Basketball,"Mike Anderson was hired as the new men’s basketball coach at St. John’s on Friday after being fired at Arkansas last month.Anderson, 59, takes over for the former St. John’s star Chris Mullin, who resigned on April 9, citing a “recent personal loss.” Mullin’s older brother, Roddy, died recently at 58 after having cancer for years.Terms of Anderson’s contract were not disclosed. He also coached at Missouri and Alabama-Birmingham before leading the Razorbacks to five postseason appearances and a 169-102 record in eight seasons.Anderson, a native of Birmingham, Ala., spent the first part of his career working for Nolan Richardson. Anderson played for Richardson at Tulsa before becoming an assistant under him there.When Richardson left for Arkansas, Anderson joined him in Fayetteville. He was an assistant at Arkansas for 17 years, helping the Razorbacks win the 1995 national championship. Anderson is 369-200 in 17 seasons as a Division I coach and has never had a losing record.He is known for coaching up-tempo teams that press on defense. Anderson said at a news conference that his goal was for St. John’s to play an exciting style of basketball, adding that the Red Storm would be “one of the top assist teams in the country” and “one of the top turnover teams in the country.”Anderson said that he envisioned a team that was unpredictable.“You don’t know what we’re going to do,” he said. “Our pressure may come from the half court. It may come full court. It may come from a zone. Now you’ve got to worry about what we’re doing. I don’t worry about what teams do. I worry more about what we’re doing.”Mullin guided the Red Storm to the N.C.A.A. tournament this year for the only time in his four seasons as the coach. They were immediately eliminated by Arizona State in an opening-round game, and the program has not won in the tournament since 2000.In the wake of Mullin’s departure, there was some criticism about the length of the hiring process, as certain top candidates withdrew from consideration.Arizona State’s Bobby Hurley and Loyola-Chicago’s Porter Moser were initially targeted as replacements for Mullin but decided to stay at their universities. Iona Coach Tim Cluess said in a statement on Thursday that he had been contacted but was withdrawing his name from consideration.The St. John’s athletic director, Mike Cragg, defended the process.“I would say nine days is a pretty thorough and efficient search,” said Cragg, who came from Duke last fall.Anderson said he had not spoken to Mullin about the state of the program, but planned to reach out to him. He will have plenty of work to do in order to build a strong Big East roster for next season. The junior guards Shamorie Ponds and Justin Simon have declared for the N.B.A. draft, and L. J. Figueroa and guard Bryan Trimble Jr. have reportedly placed their names in the transfer portal.The new coach, who does not have ties to New York, said his plan was to recruit in the area."
Basketball,"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The families of several University of North Carolina women’s basketball players complained last week of racially insensitive remarks by Sylvia Hatchell, the program’s Hall of Fame coach, who was subsequently put on leave, according to two people with direct knowledge of the allegations.Hatchell’s lawyer, Wade M. Smith, said in an interview Thursday that his client was aware of the accusations that were described in detail by one of the people with direct knowledge. He said his client’s words had been misquoted or misconstrued.The families detailed their concerns in a meeting that some U.N.C. officials attended in Chapel Hill while the athletic director, Bubba Cunningham, joined by video conference from another location, according to the person who described the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.The meeting included accusations that Hatchell had warned that a loss to Louisville could lead to “nooses,” according to the person, and that the coach had once urged players to do a “tomahawk chop” war cry, a request the women resisted.Within days of the meeting, the university, which has been in the midst of a reckoning over racism and Confederate history, announced that Hatchell and her three assistants would be put on paid administrative leave while an outside law firm conducted a review to “assess the culture of the women’s basketball program and the experience of our student-athletes.”The announcement stunned North Carolina and appeared abrupt, but in the discussion with university officials on March 28, players’ relatives said Hatchell’s conduct had caused discomfort during at least two basketball seasons, according to the person.The families also told university officials that Hatchell had complained that her team played like “old mules” during a game against Georgia Tech — a remark that some took as a reference to female slaves and that caused at least one player to cry, according to the person.In another instance, according to the person, the families said that Hatchell had warned that if U.N.C. turned in a middling performance against Louisville, “nooses” would await.“If you guys play this way against Louisville, they’re going to take y’all outside with some nooses,” Hatchell said, according to the person, who was told of the remark by people who were present.The reference to “nooses,” the person said, led to two apologies from Hatchell, the second because players thought the first one had lacked sincerity. The players remained frustrated with their coach but elected to wait until the off-season to address their concerns.Smith said the coach had used different words when warning about the coming Louisville game. “She said words like: ‘They’re going to hang us out to dry. They’re going to take a rope and hang us out to dry,’” the lawyer said.Smith said his client “doesn’t have a racist bone in her body.”Allegations of racism against Hatchell were first reported by The Washington Post.Five days after U.N.C.’s season ended, with a 20-point loss to California in the opening round of the N.C.A.A. tournament, the families voiced their grievances in the meeting.A North Carolina athletic department spokesman declined to comment. When the university announced the review on Monday, it said it was “committed to the well-being of our student-athletes and to ensuring that they have the best experience possible in and outside of competition.”"
Basketball,"NEW YORK — After a meandering search, St. John's finally settled on Mike Anderson as its new basketball coach.Anderson was hired Friday by the Red Storm after getting fired at Arkansas last month. He also had head coaching stints with Missouri and UAB before leading the Razorbacks to five postseason appearances and a 169-102 record in eight seasons.Once he was let go, it didn't take long for Anderson to land another job. Terms of the contract were not disclosed.""I've been dreaming about this moment for the last nine days,"" St. John's athletic director Mike Cragg said during a news conference at Madison Square Garden. ""And I found the right guy. We are going to win championships.""The 59-year-old Anderson takes over for former St. John's star Chris Mullin, who resigned on April 9, citing a ""recent personal loss."" His older brother, Roddy, died last month at 58 after battling cancer for years.Anderson said he had not spoken to Mullin about the state of the program, but planned to reach out to him. Mullin guided the Red Storm to the NCAA Tournament this year for the only time in his four seasons at the helm. They were immediately eliminated by Arizona State in a First Four game, and the school doesn't have an NCAA Tournament victory since 2000.In the wake of Mullin's departure, St. John's drew criticism for being unable to lure initial coaching candidates during a protracted hiring process.Arizona State's Bobby Hurley and Loyola-Chicago's Porter Moser were targeted before deciding to stay at their schools. Iona coach Tim Cluess said in a statement Thursday he was contacted but was withdrawing his name from consideration. And according to reports, St. John's spoke to Yale coach James Jones and former Georgia Tech and George Mason coach Paul Hewitt about the job as well.In a radio interview Wednesday on WFAN, wealthy alum Mike Repole was critical of President Conrado ""Bobby"" Gempesaw, Vice President Joe Oliva, and the school's board of trustees.Ultimately, the Red Storm decided on Anderson, who is 369-200 in 17 seasons as a Division I head coach. He has never had a losing record.Neither Oliva nor Cragg would comment specifically on Repole's criticism, but both defended the process the school went through before picking Anderson.""I would say nine days is a pretty thorough and efficient search,"" said Cragg, who came to St. John's from Duke last fall.Anderson, a native of Birmingham, Alabama, spent the first part of his career working for Nolan Richardson. Anderson played for Richardson at Tulsa before becoming an assistant under him with the Golden Hurricane.When Richardson left for Arkansas, Anderson joined him in Fayetteville. He was an assistant coach at Arkansas for 17 years, helping the Razorbacks win the 1995 national championship.Known for coaching up-tempo teams that press on defense, Anderson said his goal is to implement an exciting style of basketball that is ""really entertaining."" He said his teams would be ""one of the top assist teams in the country."""
Basketball,"Jonas Wood’s East Hollywood studio — a refurbished industrial space hidden behind a razor-wired metal gate — is populated with the familiar objects that appear in his paintings. There are colonies of potted plants and basketball paraphernalia that ranges in size from plush couch cushions to man-sized orbs. Every room is filled with art, most notably by the ceramist Shio Kusaka, Wood’s studio mate and wife, and Kiki and Momo, their son and daughter. But the studio is where Wood culls various photographs from the internet or his own archive and uses them as source material for his paintings — they are printed out and pinned onto walls, then flattened and distilled into blocks of color. Wood then layers these dense graphic patterns, overlapping fields of stipples and stripes, circles, squares, dots and wood grains.[Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.]Thirteen years into his career, following a year and a half of preparation, Wood is finally wrapping up preparations for the two biggest shows he’s ever done: an exhibition of new work at Gagosian in New York, opening in late April, and a survey at the Dallas Museum of Art, opening this week — his first major solo museum exhibition. Admittedly, the prospect of facing works — landscapes, interiors and portraits of family and friends — from his early career was giving Wood “a hard time sleeping.” He wondered, “Are the old paintings horrible?” and “Did I used to be a better painter and now I’m worse?” During the installation of the show at the museum last week, he had two big realizations: “I wasn’t a hack, which is a big relief,” and that now, after more than a decade of steadily producing gallery shows, he might be ready to slow down.Nursing a can of tangerine-flavored LaCroix, Wood answered T’s Artist’s Questionnaire, which unearthed memories of the early days of his career, the first painting he ever sold — and the YouTube videos that nearly brought him to tears.What is your day like? How much do you sleep, and what’s your work schedule like?I drop the kids off at school, eat some breakfast, start working a little bit, usually have a meeting, have lunch and work for a couple hours in the afternoon. Maybe I’ll work for a couple hours at night. I’m trying to sleep more. In general, in the last couple of years, I’ve been trying to balance sleeping, eating, working, working out and spending time with the family. I’ve had my head down trying to make it as an artist since 2006, and I’ve had one or two shows a year for 12 years in a row. It’s not that I want to paint less, per se, but I want to take a step back.I’m talking about taking a step back and looking at what I’ve done, and taking a step back from the pace that I was running and changing gears. After these two exhibitions, I don’t have any booked shows coming up. It’s a big opportunity for me to rearrange the way I spend my time. I love to paint and I want to paint, but I don’t have to paint right now, this second, and I don’t have to paint all next week and miss four school events.How many hours of creative work do you think you do in a day?Every day, I’m super into it. I need to paint. If I go away for a couple weeks, I’ll just draw. It’s like a must for my mental health. I would have to say that I’ve been all-in on painting since I was younger, and I realized that it was because of a lot of fear that it would all go away. That’s not how I want to paint in the future. The pressure and psychology of that setup isn’t totally right. I would like to build bodies of work outside the calendar schedule of art fairs and shows for a little while. I love painting, and I think I can paint without having a giant carrot in front of me. I don’t think that I’m the best at painting, and I want to get better at it.What’s the first piece of art you ever made?The first painting I really cared about was probably when I was a teenager, maybe 13 or 14 years old.What’s the worst studio you ever had?The freezing-cold basement of my parents’ house on Martha’s Vineyard. Winter of 2002.What’s the first work you ever sold? For how much?"
Basketball,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Consider the following scenes from the N.B.A.’s annual bacchanal/business convention known as All-Star weekend:Spike Lee standing on a street corner waiting for the crosswalk signal. Stan Kroenke, whose family owns the Denver Nuggets, holding court in a hotel lobby. Joel Embiid, the star center of the Philadelphia 76ers, making small talk with the governor of North Carolina. An army of personal stylists waiting to be summoned by their clients for some of the flashiest events of the year.And then there were the agents and league officials and sneakerheads and reporters, some of whom traveled great distances to make unconventional requests of the weekend’s main attractions.“Shout out to my fans in Mongolia!” John Collins of the Atlanta Hawks yelled into a camera the morning before his appearance in the Saturday slam dunk contest.[Slam Dunk Contest: Hamidou Diallo’s Dunk Is Even Better Viewed Frame by Frame]All-Star weekend tends to be a blend of basketball and branding, business and pleasure — a showcase for a powerful league whose global influence continues to expand.“The whole weekend,” Mike Conley of the Memphis Grizzlies said, “is just a big party.”The All-Star Game itself, scheduled for Sunday night, felt secondary to just about everything else in the host city, as it has for many years. Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, recalled waiting in line in 2006 for one of the more popular parties at All-Star weekend in Houston, where he watched Maciej Lampe — a center from Poland who appeared in 64 career games over parts of three seasons — bypass the line so that he could immediately be waved inside by security.“And I’m like, ‘Man, I’m behind Maciej Lampe?’” said Morey, who would officially join the front office of the Rockets a little more than six weeks later.All-Star weekend has only grown in recent years. One spreadsheet making the rounds in Charlotte listed more than 100 parties, and that did not include many of the more exclusive events. (Michael Jordan hosted a big one.) Thanks to a change in the league schedule, there is more partying and less deal-making than there used to be.Last year, the league moved the trade deadline up so that it preceded All-Star weekend. In the past, the deadline came a few days after the game, a sequence which helped create its share of absurdity. One of the more notorious examples came in 2017, when word leaked during the fourth quarter of the All-Star Game that the New Orleans Pelicans had struck a deal to acquire DeMarcus Cousins from the Sacramento Kings. Cousins learned of the trade during postgame interviews.The weekend vibe is different now.“It’s so much more fun,” one prominent agent said at a party that he hosted.In the corner, a disc jockey who appeared to be in his 60s spun tunes in a Hawaiian shirt and red-tinted glasses, while women wearing bright red dresses passed out hors d’oeuvres. Agents, clients and marketing honchos milled about the room.But none of this is meant to suggest that deals do not get done."
Basketball,"Marc Stein, an N.B.A. reporter for more than 30 years who now covers the league for The New York Times, and Ralph Lawler, longtime broadcaster for the Los Angeles Clippers, were honored on Friday by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, which named them as the 2019 Curt Gowdy Media Award recipients for their contributions to basketball.Stein, 49, and Lawler, 80, will be among those honored at the Hall of Fame’s September enshrinement ceremonies in Springfield, Mass.Stein started his career covering the Clippers and then the Lakers for The Los Angeles Daily News, before moving to The Dallas Morning News as a Mavericks beat reporter and eventually a national columnist. From there, he went to ESPN for 15 years, developing a reputation for breaking news and helping the network build its digital coverage of the N.B.A. He joined The Times in 2017.Lawler has announced that he will retire at the end of this season after more than 2,000 broadcasts in his 30 years with the Clippers. He established his reputation as a broadcaster in Philadelphia, working on Phillies, Flyers and 76ers games.The Hall of Fame also announced 13 finalists for induction this year, including four first-time finalists: Marques Johnson, the 1977 national collegiate player of the year; Jack Sikma, a seven-time N.B.A. All-Star; Ben Wallace, a four-time recipient of the Defensive Player of the Year Award; and Paul Westphal, a four-time All-Star and a longtime coach.The other finalists are Leta Andrews, Hugh Evans, Bill Fitch, Bobby Jones, Sidney Moncrief, Barbara Stevens, Eddie Sutton, Teresa Weatherspoon and Chris Webber.The election results will be announced at the men’s Final Four in April."
Basketball,"A student at a Catholic school in Kentucky has sued the Northern Kentucky Health Department, claiming it violated his First Amendment rights by barring him from playing basketball because he refused to be vaccinated against chickenpox.The lawsuit, filed last week in Boone County Circuit Court on behalf of the student, Jerome Kunkel, an 18-year-old senior, argues that the action violates his right to freedom of religion. Being vaccinated, it contends, would go against Mr. Kunkel’s religious beliefs as a practicing Catholic, because the vaccine contains “aborted fetal cells.”The lawsuit came after an outbreak of chickenpox at Assumption Academy in Walton, Ky., prompted officials to send out two warnings in February.On March 14, the Health Department issued a statement saying that because there had been 32 cases of chickenpox at the school, students who were not vaccinated or already immune could not attend school “until 21 days after the onset of rash for the last ill student or staff member.” The statement also said all school extracurricular events would be canceled.Mr. Kunkel’s lawyer, Chris Wiest, said in an interview on Monday that the school had told him in February that he could not play in or attend any basketball games because he was not vaccinated.Mr. Kunkel is also now barred from attending school because of the Health Department’s action.“I’m pretty devastated,” Mr. Kunkel, who was captain of the basketball team, said in an interview on Monday night. After playing for all four years of high school, “for it come crashing down at the end, it’s not very fun,” he added. Mr. Kunkel was not able to play in the last three games of the season.The lawsuit contends that in Kentucky, students are allowed a vaccination exemption on religious grounds if they provide a sworn statement, which Mr. Kunkel did in early 2018.The chickenpox vaccine is grown in cells originally derived from fetuses aborted in the early 1960s. Vaccines may contain nanofragments of DNA from the fetal cells, which are used because human viruses do not grow well in animal cells, according to a statement the vaccine’s manufacturer, Merck, gave to ABC News.It is unclear how many students have been barred from attending the school because they have not been vaccinated or were found to be immune. Mr. Wiest, however, said that the parents of at least 18 children at the school had contacted him since the Health Department’s announcement.“I think this is going to be a much bigger fight at the end of the day,” Mr. Wiest said.Officials at the school did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. But the Health Department defended its response to the outbreak.The action, the department said in its statement, was “in direct response to a public health threat and was an appropriate and necessary response to prevent further spread of this contagious illness.” A spokesman for the department declined to comment further."
Basketball,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Kirstjen Nielsen stepped down on Sunday after a rocky tenure in which she supported President Trump’s hard-line immigration policies even as he blamed her for the increased number of migrants illegally entering the U.S. (Read her resignation letter.)After assuming the post in late 2017, Ms. Nielsen led the department during the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy along the Mexican border, which initially resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their families.What’s next: Mr. Trump named Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, as acting secretary. In announcing a recent spike in the number of illegal border crossings, Mr. McAleenan said last month, “This is clearly both a border security and a humanitarian crisis.”Catch up: On Friday, Mr. Trump withdrew his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Ronald Vitiello, saying he wanted the agency to go in a “tougher” direction.Fighting for survival before parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unexpectedly promised over the weekend to begin extending sovereignty over the West Bank if he is re-elected.The West Bank is home to 2.6 million Palestinians, who view the area as the possible site of a future Palestinian state.Mr. Netanyahu’s major rival, the former army chief Benny Gantz, and analysts dismissed the plan as a last-ditch effort to rally Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing base.Explainer: Mr. Netanyahu is one of Israel’s longest-serving leaders, but he is facing his strongest challenge in years from Mr. Gantz and the leaders of a centrist alliance. Here’s a guide to Tuesday’s voting. Antibiotics, which have been credited with saving tens of millions of lives, have never been more accessible to the poor, thanks largely to the mass production of generics in China and India. Across much of the developing world, a few dollars will buy drugs like amoxicillin, which treats a broad range of infections.But the increasingly available drugs are losing their ability to kill the germs they were designed to cure. Poverty is a huge and largely unappreciated driver of antibiotic resistance, which is often viewed as a problem in rich countries.“We are quickly running out of treatment options,” a researcher in Kenya said. “If we don’t get a handle on the problem, I fear for the future.”Another angle: A fungus called Candida auris preys on people with weakened immune systems, and it is quietly spreading across the globe. It adds a frightening new dimension to the threat posed by the overuse of antibiotics.Jake Orta lives three blocks from Mark Zuckerberg’s $10 million home in San Francisco. A military veteran who now lives in government-subsidized housing, Mr. Orta is part of an underground economy, scavenging through others’ trash.Mr. Orta sells what he retrieves around town and says his goal is to earn around $30 to $40 a day."
Basketball,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Mr. Trump moved on Monday to clear out the top ranks of the Department of Homeland Security, a day after the resignation of its secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen.The White House announced the departure of the director of the Secret Service, Randolph Alles, and more high-ranking officials are expected to leave soon.The moves reflected the president’s frustration about immigration and security, and appeared to be a housecleaning of officials associated with John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff who was also Mr. Trump’s first Homeland Security secretary.What’s next: Mr. Trump’s push for tougher immigration policies includes the possible return of a measure that separated migrant families, current and former officials said. The Daily: In today’s episode, a reporter who covers immigration for The Times discusses Ms. Nielsen’s tenure.Another angle: In clamping down on migrants, Mr. Trump has said “Our country is full.” Demographers and economists disagree. The country heads into parliamentary elections today with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a veteran politician of the Israeli right, facing stiff competition from a centrist rival, Benny Gantz, a former army general. Here’s a look at the voting process and what’s at stake.Mr. Netanyahu has overseen healthy economic growth, but charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust have loomed over his campaign. We’ll have live coverage as the polls close at 3 p.m. Eastern.News analysis: Mr. Netanyahu has promised to begin annexing parts of the West Bank, which would flout four decades of U.S. policy. He was emboldened by President Trump’s support, our White House correspondent writes.Yesterday: In another move that could help Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Trump designated a powerful arm of Iran’s military — the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps — as a foreign terrorist organization. It was the first time the U.S. has made such a declaration about part of another country’s government. Mr. Netanyahu and Trump administration officials have said Iran is the greatest threat facing Israel.Tens of thousands of demonstrators in Sudan are demanding the departure of the country’s authoritarian ruler. Algeria’s longtime leader was forced out. And in Libya, an aging general is promising to end the chaos that followed the ouster of the dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011.The uprisings across the Arab world eight years ago are still reverberating across North Africa, but the renewed unrest shows that the problems that led to the earlier uprisings remain. Those include growing populations of disaffected young people, closed and corrupt economies, and authoritarian governments unresponsive to the public.What’s next: President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt is to meet President Trump at the White House today. Mr. el-Sisi, 64, is seeking at least a tacit blessing before a referendum to change the Egyptian constitution so that he can stay in power until 2034 — in effect, as president for life.Kelly Catlin, 23, won a silver medal in cycling at the 2016 Olympics and had a shot at gold at the 2020 Games.

Basketball,"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Sylvia Hatchell, the University of North Carolina women’s basketball coach, used to preach about “the fishbowl.”“You’re always in the fishbowl,” Hatchell would tell players like Tonya Sampson, a former player who recalled the admonitions in an interview on Friday. “You never know who’s watching. You’ve always got to carry yourself with integrity and the best way you can.”Twenty-five years after Hatchell and Sampson won a national title for North Carolina, Hatchell’s reputation is in peril and her team is in turmoil. U.N.C. officials, who were told late last month about three episodes that some players thought revealed Hatchell to be racially insensitive and aloof, placed her and her assistants on paid administrative leave and opened a storied program to abrupt scrutiny.An outside law firm is investigating. Several U.N.C. players are considering transferring. And Hatchell, 67, one of women’s basketball’s most successful and influential coaches and a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, is not talking beyond a single written statement.It seems no one, from high-ranking state lawmakers to parents of players, is certain whether she will coach again at U.N.C., a Southern powerhouse of athletics and academics that has spent years grappling with issues of race. Hatchell’s lawyer, Wade M. Smith, could only say, “I hope she does come back.”The allegations against Hatchell, privately detailed to university officials on March 28 and in news media accounts in the week that followed, represent a grave test to her 33-year tenure at U.N.C., where she is under contract for just one more season. And although the just-concluded season was modestly more successful than other recent campaigns, Hatchell has lately led a program that felt removed from the one that, not long ago, routinely won at least 25 games a year.This year, in its first appearance in the N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament since the 2014-15 season, U.N.C. (18-15) exited in the first round with a 20-point loss to California.Hatchell’s critics have been reluctant to speak publicly, in part, they said, because they fear retaliation. After so many years, Hatchell has become an institution at U.N.C., not quite on par with Dean Smith, the revered former men’s coach, but not far off. Many current and former players did not respond to messages, but some who did expressed support for Hatchell, even as they depicted her as a coach of searing, drawling intensity.The university said it had hired a Charlotte law firm to “assess the culture of the women’s basketball program and the experience of our student-athletes.” Officials have declined to comment beyond that.The law firm is expected to examine the quality of medical care for players and whether Hatchell had warned her team that “nooses” would await them if they turned in a poor performance against Louisville. U.N.C. officials were also told that Hatchell had urged her players to perform a “tomahawk chop” war cry to fire them up — a suggestion the women resisted — and that she had described players as “old mules.” Some people perceived the comment as a reference to female slaves.Smith, Hatchell’s lawyer, said the coach “doesn’t have a racist bone in her body.”He said some players had misconstrued Hatchell’s words, but he acknowledged that she had apologized after an internal uproar about the episode in which people recalled that she had referred to nooses.“She said words like, ‘They’re going to hang us out to dry. They’re going to take a rope and hang us out to dry,’” Smith said. He added that Hatchell, who did not believe she had said anything improper, initially apologized by saying something like, “I’m sorry you took it that way.”“The team did not see that as an apology,” Smith said. “I think she thought she apologized.”But a furor still built, and the university, whose trustees declined to comment or did not respond to messages, will soon have to decide the fate of the coach, who cultivated the modern women’s game and has been known more for her fiery courtside coaching than personal controversy."
Basketball,"Good morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)This year the best college basketball team from California is not U.C.L.A.; it is not Stanford, or San Diego State.No, this year, the best college basketball team from California might just be the University of California, Irvine.Yes, you read that right. The Anteaters. (Zot! Zot! Zot!)“We’re one of the top teams on the West Coast, and we have proven we’re probably the best team in California,” Ryan Badrtalei, an assistant coach at U.C. Irvine, said in a telephone interview on Monday.Of course, claims like these are hotly debated at this time of year. But on Sunday, the N.C.A.A. selection committee announced the 68 teams that will play in the Division I men’s basketball tournament, and only two of them were from California: U.C. Irvine and Saint Mary’s, which earned its bid by winning the West Coast Conference tournament.Badrtalei certainly has a case. U.C. Irvine beat Saint Mary’s this season on its way to a 30-5 record, good enough to earn the team a No. 13 seed in the South Region of the N.C.A.A. tournament. U.C. Irvine will play Kansas State on Friday in San Jose.The No. 13 seed means the Anteaters are an underdog in that game. But the team has also been a trendy upset pick among experts, some of whom think the team could make something of a Cinderella run.“The Anteaters are a terrible draw for Kansas State, and their upset odds are two times better than you would expect for a typical No. 13 seed,” The Washington Post’s Neil Greenberg wrote Sunday after the bracket was unveiled. Badrtalei said this year’s team features several upperclassmen who have helped them beat squads like Texas A&M and Saint Mary’s on the road — wins that give the Anteaters confidence that they can hang with stiff competition.Veteran players like Jonathan Galloway, who is a first team all-conference selection, has helped anchor the Anteaters defensively. The team prides itself on rebounding well and being a “a real stubborn defensive team,” Badrtalei said, adding that Kansas State plays a similar style.“We’re going to have to go out and play really well,” Badrtalei said of Friday’s matchup. “But these guys know their roles. They know what they’re doing. We purposely recruit guys who have a chip on their shoulders. We like that. We like being in the position where we have to perform.”So can they pull off the upset?Said Badrtalei: “There’s not a question in our minds.”"
Basketball,"A federal judge in Manhattan on Tuesday sentenced three men in a college basketball fraud case to between six and nine months in prison, lenient sentences that the judge said were nonetheless important to deter the funneling of money to the families of college basketball prospects — an N.C.A.A. violation that a jury found last year also constituted a felony.The sentences come ahead of a second trial next month at which more may be revealed about how widespread the rot in recruiting has spread.James Gatto, the former head of global basketball marketing at Adidas, was sentenced to nine months by U.S. District Court Judge Lewis A. Kaplan. Merl Code Jr., another former Adidas employee, and Christian Dawkins, an aspiring agent, were given six months each. Code and Dawkins, who are also defendants in next month’s trial, were ordered to pay restitution of a little more than $28,000 each, with Gatto’s amount of restitution still to be determined.Kaplan ruled that the punishments would not go into effect until the appeal process is completed. The defendants have two weeks to ask the federal circuit court to re-examine the case.A jury convicted the three men last fall of defrauding the University of Louisville and, in Gatto’s case, also North Carolina State University and the University of Kansas. The men participated in a scheme in which the families of highly rated men’s basketball recruits were offered money in exchange for pledges to play for one of those teams, which are sponsored by Adidas. Prosecutors argued that by unknowingly making the universities vulnerable to N.C.A.A. sanctions, the defendants had victimized the schools.Such offers are barred by N.C.A.A. rules, which require that college athletes adhere to the association’s policy of amateurism and not be compensated for their participation in their sport beyond a scholarship and related costs of attendance.Repercussions from the charges brought by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York have already included the firing of a Hall of Fame coach — Rick Pitino, formerly of Louisville, who denies wrongdoing and whom prosecutors did not charge. A Kansas player was ruled ineligible early this year after his connection to the scheme came to light.The lawyers for Code and Dawkins welcomed the sentence.“Happy might be the wrong word, but the judge granted a lenient sentence,” said Steve Haney, who represents Dawkins.Haney also promised that the second trial, which involves alleged bribes to assistant coaches at top men’s basketball programs, would not only exonerate Dawkins but would also show how college basketball business is really done.“We’re going to pull back the covers,” he said, adding, “This could transform college basketball and put the players in a situation moving forward so they and their labor are treated fairly.”Haney pledged to put coaches on the stand — “as many as I can get into the courtroom.”Robert S. Khuzami, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York in this case, said in a statement, “The sentences imposed today only begin to reflect the magnitude of the harm these defendants caused through a scheme that not only defrauded multiple public universities but upended the lives of young student-athletes and corrupted a game cherished by so many.”Tuesday’s sentencing hearing in a packed courtroom on a high floor of the federal district building in downtown Manhattan saw all three defendants as well as their lawyers address the court and plead for leniency. They requested no jail time at all. While most of these statements referred to the defendants’ personal characters, some of the attorneys also pointed to the unusual nature of the case, which depended on a theory in which the universities were victimized by the defendants’ attempts to secure them top talent (albeit while putting them at risk of N.C.A.A. penalties).“If he thought that anyone would conceive what he did here as a crime, he would never have done it,” Code’s lawyer, Mark Moore, said of his client."
Basketball,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Lawmakers today again refused to endorse Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to withdraw Britain from the European Union.After two previous rejections, the vote leaves Mrs. May’s deal in ruins and adds further confusion to the country’s politics, just two weeks before the scheduled departure date.What’s next: The defeat appears to leave the increasingly weakened prime minister with two unpalatable options in the short run: Britain can leave the bloc on April 12 with no deal, a chaotic and potentially economically damaging withdrawal; or Mrs. May can ask European leaders — who have ruled out a short delay if her plan failed — for what could be a long postponement.Shares of Lyft, the ride-hailing company, opened for trading today at $87.24, above the public offering price of $72. At the I.P.O. price, Lyft had a market value of over $24 billion, making it one of the most valuable American companies to go public in the last decade.What’s next: Among those expected to follow in Lyft’s footsteps are its main rival, Uber, as well as the digital pinboard company Pinterest and the messaging platform Slack. Beyond cementing the place of the companies in people’s lives, public trading would unleash a new wave of wealth in the tech industry. Here’s a look at who stands to get rich.A lawsuit filed on Thursday accused members of the Sackler family, who own the maker of the opioid painkiller OxyContin, of systematic fraud. The suit also includes major pharmaceutical companies that distributed alarming amounts of prescription painkillers during a rising abuse epidemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people across the U.S.The state is seeking, among other goals, to claw back money that it says was transferred from the Sackler-owned Purdue Pharma to private or offshore accounts in an effort to shield the assets from litigation.Response: A spokesman for the Sackler family called the allegations “a misguided attempt to place blame where it does not belong for a complex public health crisis. We strongly deny these allegations, which are inconsistent with the factual record, and will vigorously defend against them.”“After three years of lies and smears and slander, the Russia hoax is finally dead,” Mr. Trump declared at a rally in Michigan on Thursday, his first since the end of the special counsel’s investigation. “The collusion delusion is over.”Mr. Trump took particular delight in ridiculing Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, who faced calls from Republicans on Thursday to step down as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. (He didn’t.) Related: The still-secret report submitted last week by the special counsel was more than 300 pages long, the Justice Department has acknowledged. Attorney General William Barr, who released a four-page summary of the report last weekend, has indicated that redacting the report for classified and grand jury information will most likely take weeks.Closer look: Mr. Trump points with pride to last year’s economic growth and promises even faster growth to come. But economic data suggest that a slowdown is underway.The Pentagon’s Africa Command recently outfitted gunships with devices that allow for covert strikes against the Shabab in Somalia. The dispensers can be discreetly fitted onto unarmed surveillance planes, too.In interviews with The Times, military officials discussed the types of weapons the Pentagon has tested, offering insight into how Special Operations forces plan to fight in the future."
Basketball,"When the left sneaker of college basketball’s biggest star split open on national television Wednesday night 30 seconds into the biggest game of the season, what spilled out was not only his foot but also questions about the future of a marquee player and about the huge influence shoe companies hold over big-time college basketball.The episode occurred in a game between the archrivals Duke and North Carolina. Zion Williamson, a Duke freshman, pivoted with the ball above the foul line, and the sheer force of his 285-pound frame and acrobatic versatility appeared to cut the shoe almost in two, as though severed by a sharp knife.Former President Barack Obama, sitting on the sidelines at the Duke arena, was seen on video pointing at Williamson and appearing to say, “His shoe broke.”As the scene was replayed on countless highlight shows on Thursday, the damaged shoe threatened to become a nightmare for Nike, which pays tens of millions to elite college sports programs to be the exclusive sponsor for teams and supplier of their footwear.With his shoe split and his knee sprained, Williamson, an unpaid, budding superstar, sat helpless on the arena floor, staring at the shoe he was wearing in part because of a rich deal between Nike and Duke, one of the world’s wealthiest universities.Here were all the issues of big-time college sports laid bare: Should amateurism be curbed in college sports, allowing athletes a cut of the money they help produce? Should a prodigious talent like Williamson, who is good enough to play professionally right now, have to risk his future competing for free because of an N.B.A. rule prohibiting him from leaping to the league from high school? Do the sneaker companies, which were at the heart of a federal fraud trial near the start of the season, do more harm than good in college sports?For a quarter of a century, Nike has been paying Duke tens of millions of dollars to sponsor its teams, and to ensure that its athletes wear only footwear bearing the company’s ubiquitous logo. The players receive enough shoes to carry them through the season, allowing them to serve largely as free human billboards.“All this does,” Gabe Feldman, who directs Tulane’s sports law program, said of Williamson’s injury, “is put a magnifying glass on an issue that has existed for a long time.”Williamson has not commented.Nike stock closed down Thursday by 1.05 percent, as the world wondered how a sneaker could split so badly in the middle of a game.The answer remains a puzzle even to experts. James Gilbert, an orthopedic surgeon who worked with Duke athletics in the 1990s, said he had seen shoes fall apart similarly on soccer players, but never on the hardwood.“I think it’s a product failure,” Gilbert said. “I’ve never seen that. I had no idea that that happens.”In a statement Wednesday night, Nike said: “We are obviously concerned and want to wish Zion a speedy recovery. The quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance.” The statement called the shoe explosion “an isolated occurrence,” though in 2015, the Kenyan marathoner Eliud Kipchoge won the Berlin Marathon even as the insoles of his Nike shoes slipped out of place.Williamson, who has a mild knee sprain, will probably be sidelined for one to two weeks, and then continue being the favorite to become the No. 1 overall pick in the N.B.A. draft in June. By then, he will probably already be a millionaire, because of the endorsement deals he can sign when he ends his college career. For now, he is an N.C.A.A. amateur.Sneaker companies first became deeply involved with college athletics in the late 1970s, when an enterprising Nike executive, Sonny Vaccaro, arranged for several prominent coaches, such as John Thompson of Georgetown and Jerry Tarkanian of Nevada-Las Vegas, to receive money in exchange for outfitting their players in the company’s shoes. Starting in the late 1980s, Nike began to sign deals that covered all of a university’s teams."
Basketball,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Mr. Trump said on Thursday that the U.S. should recognize Israel’s authority over the long disputed Golan Heights, overturning decades of American policy in the Middle East.Mr. Trump’s announcement on Twitter came after persistent pressure from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, an ally who is fighting for his political life with an election scheduled for next month. While popular in Israel and among some U.S. lawmakers, Mr. Trump’s decision is likely to be condemned almost everywhere else. Catch up: The United Nations has rejected Israel’s occupation of the Golan Heights since 1967, when Israeli troops seized the 400 square miles from Syria during the Arab-Israeli War. Here’s a brief history of the dispute. What’s next: Practically speaking, Mr. Trump’s announcement doesn’t change much, as the status of the Golan Heights is not under negotiation, and there’s no expectation that Israel will withdraw. But symbolically, the decision shakes up a debate that has changed little since the 1970s.European Union officials agreed on Thursday to extend the deadline for Britain’s withdrawal from the bloc until May 22, as long as Prime Minister Theresa May can persuade Parliament to accept her plan for doing so. If she can’t — and lawmakers have already rejected her proposal twice — the deadline would be moved up to April 12.The agreement effectively averted a disorderly and chaotic departure at the end of next week, yet such a break remains a possibility.What’s next: Neither side wants Britain to leave without a deal. European Union officials said they remained open to a longer delay but that it would require Britain to participate in European Parliament elections — something that Mrs. May has said would be an absurdity.A week after the terrorist attack on two mosques that left 50 people dead, mourners from around the world gathered in Christchurch, New Zealand, today to share the Muslim call to prayer and two minutes of silence.“This terrorist sought to tear our nation apart with an evil ideology that has torn the world apart — but instead we have shown that New Zealand is unbreakable,” said Imam Gamal Fouda of Al Noor Mosque, one of the two attacked.Related: In addition to announcing a ban on the type of weapons used in the shooting, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has pledged to hold social media companies accountable for letting hateful speech thrive on their platforms. As of Thursday, at least two people have been charged in New Zealand with spreading the killer’s video of part of the attack.The Daily: Today’s episode is about the speed with which New Zealand planned changes to its gun laws after the attack.The country’s national airline said today that it had asked to cancel an order of 737 Max 8 jets. It is the first publicly confirmed attempt to stop a deal since the planes were involved in two deadly crashes. A spokesman for the carrier, Garuda Indonesia, said that its passengers had lost confidence in the model. But he acknowledged that it would be difficult to cancel a signed agreement.Garuda’s deal was for 49 planes, and estimated to be worth $4.9 billion. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment."
Basketball,"THE FALCONER By Dana Czapnik 278 pp. Atria Books. $25.Toward the end of “The Falconer,” Dana Czapnik’s electric debut novel, 17-year-old Lucy Adler looks up from Simone de Beauvoir’s “The Second Sex” at the Japanese maple on her Upper West Side neighbor’s terrace. It’s difficult to read the passage and not think of beloved Francie Nolan peering out another window in another New York City borough, almost 100 years earlier. Yet whereas in “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,” both Francie and the Tree of Heaven grow up amid an unforgiving, concrete urban setting, Czapnik’s maple has been coaxed and cared for, its leaves treated with a protective coating. Lucy, a middle-class Manhattanite attending an elite private school, has battled none of the Nolan family’s hardships, nor is she plagued by the acerbic ennui that Holden Caulfield gave voice to in “The Catcher in the Rye,” but comparisons to both classic New York bildungsromans nonetheless seem inevitable. That is, until you realize that what binds them — all tell of a determinedly independent young hero’s quest for selfhood catalyzed by the crucible of New York City — is also what makes them so resistant to comparison. Like Francie and Holden before her, Lucy, a street-smart, superlative basketballer vulnerable to the perils of approaching womanhood, is too carefully drawn to be equated with anyone else.Lucy’s fierce first-person point of view is as confident and fearless as she is on the court; she narrates her story with the immediacy and sharpness of a sports commentator, mixed with the pathos and wisdom of a perceptive adolescent charting the perils of her senior year of high school. A self-described “pizza bagel — a Jewish and Italian mutt-girl,” Lucy grapples with the rigid expectations of others, especially her harshly critical high school peers who have rendered her an outcast. “Isn’t it just so much easier for everybody when a girl fits into a nice little girl category — good girl slut tomboy girly girl smart girl ditz — instead of being a fully fleshed-out person who is in constant conversation … with all the various fractious parts of herself,” Lucy wisely observes. We watch that conversation unfold in real time through her adventures with her best friend, Alexis, a tough-talking Dominican sage tethered to Lucy through basketball and their shared outsider status; Lucy’s forays into the navel-gazing Downtown arts scene of her painter cousin, Violet; and, most pulverizing, her unrequited love for her emotionally unavailable scrimmage partner Percy, a self-proclaimed nihilist from a neglected but moneyed family who goes through girlfriends like Kleenex and is referred to by friends as the “Virgin Surgeon.”But it’s arguably the nonhuman characters that give true shape to Lucy’s evolution: basketball and New York. (The novel’s opening line, “The ball is a face,” confirms the game’s significance and anthropomorphism for her.) Only with ball in hand does Lucy feel invincible and most herself, even as that self changes: “I ought not to imbue a ball with so much magic, but when I’m holding one I go from Lucy Adler, invisible girl … to Lucy Adler, Warrior Goddess.” Her self-descriptions on the court are as visceral and vivid as any sex scene, and when the actual sex scene does eventually unfold it is against the backdrop of a Rangers game on television, the commentators’ play-by-play mirroring Lucy’s own disembodied narration of her experience.The basketball grows into a metaphor for the universe: “I bounce the world hard on the blacktop, and it comes back into my hand covered with a fine layer of New York City diamond dust.” The entire novel is indeed cloaked in just such a glimmering film, and Lucy’s love-hate relationship with her roiling city reflects her changeable hopes for herself and others. “I guess New York is like that, in that what you mistake it for matters as much as what it actually is.” Czapnik, who herself grew up in Manhattan around the same time as Lucy, captures nostalgia — for both a vanishing New York and Lucy’s evaporating childhood — with the lucidity of a V.R. headset. The early-90s era seems unremarkable to the characters in the thick of it — “We live in … insignificant times,” Lucy says between hits of a joint — but feels poignantly pre-9/11 to today’s reader.Lucy’s coming-of-age is tempered by her constant brush-ups against the constrictions society places on her sex. Happening upon “The Falconer,” a bronze of a boy in Elizabethan dress releasing a falcon in Central Park, Lucy is envious that statues of boys depict them in action poses while women are either demure nudes or Alice in Wonderland. “Don’t you wish they made statues of girls like that?” Lucy asks Alexis. “Just some girl having unapologetic fun.” Alexis replies: “I never apologize for the fun I have. And neither do you.” Reader, beware: Spending time with Lucy is unapologetic fun, and heartbreak, and awe as well."
Basketball,"BUIES CREEK, N.C. — With three seconds left in the first half last Wednesday night, Campbell point guard Chris Clemons was fouled on a layup. He banged the floor in frustration as the ball rimmed out, then rose and hit both free throws. Someone in the sparsely populated stands yelled, “Congratulations, Chris!” Given the size of the crowd, it’s almost certain Clemons heard him.The second free throw was Clemons’s 22nd point of the night, and the 2,952nd of his four-season career at Campbell, a private university about an hour’s drive south of Raleigh, N.C., his hometown. It also meant Clemons, a senior, had entered the top 10 of the men’s Division I college basketball career scoring list, passing the former Kansas star Danny Manning. By the end of the game, when Clemons had finished off a season-high 48-point effort, he had passed Oscar Robertson, too.“It’s kind of a gift and a curse that you’re not really able to enjoy the moment — or that I chose not to, rather,” Clemons said. “I do understand the significance of the events.”History is being made in college basketball this season, but not all of it is being made for teams that are likely bound for the Final Four or by players who are projected to be selected early in the next N.B.A. draft.With 3,006 career points at Campbell, Clemons is two behind Hersey Hawkins, the former Bradley player, for eighth all time, heading into Thursday’s game with High Point. At South Dakota State, another senior, Mike Daum, is poised to break into the top 10 by season’s end; with 2,943 points, he could pass Manning in the Jackrabbits’ game on Thursday against Fort Wayne.It is an unignorable fact that most of the players still ahead of Clemons and Daum on the career scoring list are not household names, either. After Hawkins, for instance, Clemons could pass Keydren Clark, who played for St. Peter’s, in Jersey City; Harry Kelly of Texas Southern, in Houston; and perhaps even Alphonso Ford of Mississippi Valley State, who holds fourth place with 3,165 points. (First place, by a country mile, with 3,667 points, is the Louisiana State legend Pete Maravich, even though he played only three seasons.)“I recognize that a lot of people on that list, who scored a lot of points in college, didn’t go on to have successful N.B.A. careers,” said Hawkins, who did have a successful N.B.A. career and now works for the Portland Trail Blazers.Freeman Williams — who is second, and the scorer of 3,249 points for Portland State — acknowledged that his college years had been his glory days. “I got most of my attention as a basketball player back then,” he said.Clemons and Daum fit in the same category. Daum is a two-time (and probable three-time) Summit League player of the year. Clemons is leading all Division I players in scoring this season, averaging nearly 30 points a game. Although both are likely to get opportunities to shine during the N.B.A.’s summer league or on its development league rosters, said Fran Fraschilla, the former coach and ESPN draft analyst, the 6-foot 9-inch Daum is at best a late-second-round draft pick. Clemons, who is listed at 5-9, is unlikely to be drafted at all.The relative anonymity of college basketball’s leading career scorers appears to be a feature, not a bug. If you are scoring so many points for so much time, you most likely are not doing so at college basketball’s heights.“If Mike Daum or Chris Clemons had gone to play in the Big Ten or the A.C.C.,” Fraschilla said last week, referring to the Atlantic Coast Conference, “they wouldn’t be on the verge of scoring 3,000 points.”He added, “As good players as they are, they would be on teams with other really talented players, as opposed to going to a school like S.D.S.U. or Campbell, where virtually from Day 1 their talent was such that they were the dominant player not only on their team but in their league.”And had they dominated as they have in a bigger league, they probably wouldn’t be seniors; the best college basketball players are around for only one or two seasons.“Let’s not kid ourselves,” said Lionel Simmons, who is third with 3,217 career points for La Salle. “Some of these players, if they didn’t come out early, they could have scored 3,000.”But even when top talents played for three or four college seasons, they did so for top teams whose other talented players lowered the individual demands on them. Superlative college players like U.C.L.A.’s Lew Alcindor (who later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and Georgetown’s Patrick Ewing had the kinds of supporting casts that come with championship teams."
Basketball,"Fans tuning in to Saturday’s marquee matchup between Duke and Virginia waited less than two minutes before getting what they came for. On an early Virginia possession, Duke’s Zion Williamson, the impossible freshman who moves with a guard’s agility while weighing 280 pounds, recovered a loose ball and hammered down a two-handed dunk with Old Testament fury.Williamson is expected to be the top pick in this year’s N.B.A. draft and has been this season’s signature player — a quality so inseparable from his ferocious slams that a rare missed dunk last week against Boston College became a highlight in its own right.The only other player who has come close to capturing the collective imagination as Williamson is Murray State’s Ja Morant, a 6-foot-3 sophomore who has played his way from virtual anonymity to likely top-five draft position on a diet of Jordan-esque leaping, flying slams.That Williamson and Morant are this season’s college basketball folk heroes is in one sense entirely logical. Dunks are popular, they dunk well, therefore they are popular.Yet in the context of recent history and current basketball trends, they are outliers as stars because they are relatively poor shooters from long distance.Neither player can efficiently utilize the 3-pointer, which has cemented itself as the most treasured tool in the modern offensive game. Williamson has made less than 30 percent of the 47 3-pointers he has attempted. Morant is at 32.7 percent, below the Division I average of 34.3 percent.Williamson’s attitude toward the 3-pointer may be best summarized not by any of his own shots, but by his sensational block of De’Andre Hunter’s ill-fated attempt late in Saturday’s game, an 81-71 Duke victory.Their proficiency in dunking over long-distance shooting signals how special they are, of course, but also might herald a market correction in which basketball’s most reliable shot is back in.In recent seasons, the defining players — the ones who made the biggest impacts and summed up the college basketball zeitgeist — have overwhelmingly been sharpshooters. Think of Oklahoma’s Trae Young and Buddy Hield, Kansas’ Frank Mason III, Indiana’s Yogi Ferrell, Purdue’s Caleb Swanigan and even Duke’s infamous Grayson Allen. The last 7-footer to be named player of the year, Wisconsin’s Frank Kaminsky, was not a high-volume shooter of 3s, but he made 41.6 percent of his attempts in his Wooden Award-winning season. Villanova won a title at the buzzer when Kris Jenkins hit a 3.Yet this year’s watch list for the Wooden Award includes Williamson and Morant along with other poor-shooting yet exciting non-big men like Duke’s R.J. Barrett and Tennessee’s Grant Williams. Marquette’s Markus Howard has received comparatively little attention as this year’s exemplary high-volume, high-accuracy distance shooter.The ESPN analyst Jay Bilas said dunks were emerging as more crucial to offenses because so-called midrange shots — 2-point attempts that are not from close in near the basket — have been so devalued by analytics. Get to the rim. Get fouled. Or take a 3. Those are the modern basketball credos.Bilas said it was possible that, after several years in which the 3-pointer has predominated in top offenses, coaches have improved at devising defenses to stymie perimeter shooting — in that way placing a premium on wing players who excel at close range. But mainly Williamson and Morant stand out because they are standouts.“We’re seeing more dunks because there are more spectacular athletes out there,” he said.“A lot of guys can dunk, but he dunks on the way up,” he added of Williamson. “His head is literally at or over the rim every time.”Recent seasons’ emphasis on the 3 was easy to understand if you looked to the N.B.A.’s discovery of the 3-pointer’s efficiency. The Golden State Warriors emerged as a dynasty thanks in part to their high-volume 3-point shooting, and even they have been surpassed by teams like the Houston Rockets who attempt 3s at record numbers while confining their other shots to the restricted area under the basket."
Basketball,"ALBANY — Lauren Mullen pulled her black hat low over her eyes, paid $10 for a ticket and entered Sefcu Arena just before tip-off recently. She sat in Section 150. There were 18 rows between her and any other fans. She trained her focus on the two head coaches.On the visiting bench sat the University of Massachusetts, Lowell coach, Tom Garrick, a former N.B.A. player. Last spring, Mullen, then the women’s basketball coach at New York University, interviewed for the position that Garrick now holds. It was the third time in four years that she had been a finalist for a Division I head-coaching job. Her résumé included a 103-58 record and five postseason berths with the Violets.On the home sideline stood Mullen’s wife, Colleen, the coach of SUNY Albany. Colleen got the job one month after Lauren lost out to Garrick. An associate coach at West Point for six years, Colleen reached the N.C.A.A. Division I tournament twice. When Albany hired Colleen, Lauren resigned from N.Y.U. to stay at home with their children: Maggie, 3, and their 1-year-old twins, Brennan and Callan.“When you think about it, if I had gotten the Lowell job, I would’ve been over there,” Lauren said, pointing to Garrick. And Colleen, she added, would have been with the children. “Crazy, just crazy,’’ she said.It is, though, the path they are taking as a same-sex coaching couple with three small children and all sorts of demands and challenges. Indeed, Colleen joined a small sorority when Albany hired her. Although the Supreme Court approved same-sex marriage three years ago and college campuses can be among the more progressive places in the United States, Colleen says she is one of only five women she knows of who are openly gay head coaches in college basketball. She recalled how Sue Johnson, her coach at the University of New Hampshire at the time who is now the athletic director at Concord Academy in Massachusetts, came out 16 years ago, when Colleen was a senior. At the time, Johnson’s longtime partner, Kelly, was pregnant, and Johnson informed the team of their relationship after a practice.It was the chaos familiar to a lot of dual-income households that led Lauren and Colleen to a crossroads last winter. After four years of matching basketball calendars to Colleen’s biological clock to plan births for the off-season, timing recruiting calls around nap schedules, and wrestling with nanny problems and a merry-go-round of fill-in babysitters, they needed a change. “We were at a breaking point,” Colleen said. “A lot of coming and going.”“Absolute insanity,” Lauren said. “To be frank, at the end of last year, it was like, ‘O.K., what are we going to do?’”Both 38, the Mullens knew one of them needed to get a Division I head coaching job so the other could afford to step back into a supporting role. A pact was made early on. They would not pursue the same jobs, though they had competed for employment once before. That occurred when they met, in 2007. At the time, Lauren was a graduate assistant at Lehigh. There was an opening for an assistant coaching position, and Lauren applied for the internal promotion. Colleen, then an assistant at Southern New Hampshire University, also applied. They possessed similar credentials. Colleen stood 5 feet 2 inches and had starred at the University of New Hampshire as a pass-first point guard. Lauren was 5-foot-4, and was a facilitator at Hofstra. Colleen, who is six months older, got the job. Soon after, they played one-on-one for the first and only time. Lauren beat Colleen. Any lingering tension turned to mutual interest. On opening day of practice that season, they went on their first date.“She didn’t hate me for that long,” Colleen said. “She got a master’s from Lehigh. She’s in good shape.”Early in their relationship, they visited Colleen’s family. While there, they realized they had played in the same Florida tournament when they were 13. Colleen found a photo that captured Lauren guarding her on an inbounds play."
Basketball,"The University of North Carolina has put the staff of its women’s basketball team on indefinite leave pending an investigation into the program.In a statement, the university said the investigation was prompted by “issues raised by student-athletes and others.”A Charlotte law firm will review the program. The head coach, Sylvia Hatchell, and her three assistants will be paid during the investigation.“Of course, I will cooperate fully in this review,” Hatchell said in a statement Monday, after the university announced its decision. “I look forward to a prompt conclusion of this matter and the continuation of our very successful women’s basketball program.”Hatchell, who has coached the team since 1986, is in the basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass. She won the national championship in 1994 and made two other Final Fours.Several highly touted players have transferred away from North Carolina in recent years, notably Diamond DeShields, who despite a strong freshman year on court moved on to Tennessee and then the W.N.B.A.Hatchell, 67, was found to have leukemia in 2013, but after treatment returned to the team.This season North Carolina was 18-15 and returned for the first time in four years to the N.C.A.A. tournament, where it lost in the first round.But her tenure recently has been rocky. Most notably, the team was at the center of an N.C.A.A. investigation into fake African Studies classes largely populated by athletes who got high grades for little, if any, work.Many of the accusations in the case focused on Jan Boxill, an academic adviser to the women’s basketball team, who was said to have improperly helped players academically and steered them to the bogus courses. She eventually resigned from the university.The N.C.A.A. eventually ruled that the team would receive no penalties because the classes were also available to nonathletes.The university has not elaborated on the nature of the complaints that prompted the new investigation."
Basketball,"For Arike Ogunbowale, the trip to the top of the Empire State Building on Wednesday was unusually fast.It had been arranged for her to bypass the lines and take express elevators to the observatory on the morning she was to become a professional basketball player. In the hours leading to the 2019 W.N.B.A. draft, these kinds of experiences did not faze Ogunbowale. Not after she had become one of the most recognizable faces in college basketball after hitting a pair of buzzer-beaters for Notre Dame in last year’s Final Four — one to slay Connecticut, the other to best Mississippi State and win the national championship.“Nah, I’m used to life throwing new things at me now,” Ogunbowale said with a smile as she looked out over the New York skyline.Even for the relentless Ogunbowale, the past week has brought a particular kind of whiplash.On Wednesday night, the Dallas Wings selected her fifth in the draft, after the Las Vegas Aces took her college teammate Jackie Young with the top pick.“You know, Dallas is a great place, and they have a great coach there, so I’m really excited,” Ogunbowale said, referring to Brian Agler, who has won the league title with teams in Seattle and Los Angeles. “I’m ready to get started.”The draft followed her vintage set of performances in this season’s Final Four: 23 points in another win over Connecticut, and a game-high 31 points in the national title game against Baylor. Ogunbowale’s final shots came after a drive to the basket that yielded two free throws in the waning seconds, her team trailing by 2 points.Then, the unthinkable: a miss. And a championship lost. Ogunbowale’s painful moment played out on the national stage, too, amplified in part by her previous success. Her mother, Yolanda, raced down from the stands after the game to reassure her, to say how proud she was.“Over time, she’s going to realize that she won’t be defined by that moment,” Yolanda said Wednesday, hours before her daughter would hear her name called at the W.N.B.A. draft at Nike’s New York headquarters. “I was just hurting for her, and for her teammates, because they wanted it so bad.”And there would be no time to process. A late Sunday night game turned into a Monday morning flight to South Bend, Ind., where Ogunbowale has one more class to complete at Notre Dame before she graduates.Then it was onto New York, to see the realization of a professional dream that dates back to high school in Wisconsin, though first Ogunbowale had to choose basketball over soccer. (Oddly enough, Baylor recruited her for soccer.) She and her mother both say she could have gone pro in that, too. Confidence, backed up by results, runs in the family.The path Ogunbowale chose has worked out pretty well. Over these last few days, her strength and her network of fans have fed off each other. Yolanda said Arike’s bubbly personality had drawn people into her orbit since she was a little girl.Fans recognized her at the airport as she headed back to school, and some approached to cheer her up. People took notice, too, up on the Empire State Building observation deck. For Ogunbowale, it is becoming clearer that everyone still sees in her that dynamic personality, that same person who hit buzzer-beaters, who scored 55 in a high school game, who can count LeBron James and Kobe Bryant among her fans.“Kobe, LeBron, all of them, they’ve missed some important shots in their lifetime,” Ogunbowale said. “It’s a part of the game, you know? I’m not going to be able to make every shot. So I’m glad about my career, and I think I had a great four years. Everybody’s been telling me that. I mean, that’s just one shot. But what you’ve done these four years for the program, for just women’s basketball in general, is big.”How big? After the loss, Bryant reached out directly to encourage her. There seems to be something about Ogunbowale that make people root for her (unless they are part of the Connecticut faithful, that is)."
Basketball,"Another wretched Knicks season has ended, but from its ashes a justifiable optimism is taking root. The Knicks have the money to add two star players this summer, and there is a growing buzz in the N.B.A. that they could acquire Kevin Durant of the Golden State Warriors and Kyrie Irving of the Boston Celtics, who can be free agents.With one of the top picks in the N.B.A. draft, optimism turns to giddiness. Could next season’s Knicks feature not only Durant and Irving but also Zion Williamson, Duke’s freshman sensation? Or will the Knicks trade their lottery pick for a standout like Anthony Davis of the New Orleans Pelicans?Such big names potentially brighten their future, but there’s another name that could make a difference: James L. Dolan.And so it must be asked: Will Dolan, the unpredictable and imperious owner of the team, find a way to mess it all up?Based on his two-decade history as owner, there is reason to wonder. For the second time in five years, the Knicks won only 17 games, a franchise low. This was also the sixth consecutive year the Knicks failed to make the playoffs, and the 12th time in the last 15 years. It’s a staggering level of impotence for a team that spends as much money as it does and has all the inherent advantages of playing in New York City at Madison Square Garden.That enduring failure, combined with Dolan’s public mistreatment of some fans, has led to a growing anger and skepticism in a disaffected, if dedicated, fan base.Watching the team spin its wheels seems part of the appeal or burden: The Knicks have committed more than $800 million in payroll over the last decade — not to mention millions more spent on a revolving door of high-profile executives — and they spend over the league salary cap each year as a matter of course. They also have averaged no fewer than 19,000 fans a game, no matter how bad they were.There are always appealing visiting teams to watch, and some seasons have started strong only to fizzle. But with such a crucial summer on the horizon, the thinking among fans and Knicks observers goes, perhaps not even Dolan can mess up this opportunity to forge a proven winner.“I wish he had a longer fuse when it comes to the fans,” said David Stern, the commissioner of the N.B.A. from 1984 to 2014. “There are some overreactions, but it will have nothing to do with free agency or how the team is run. That all falls on Steve Mills and Scott Perry. Him having a short fuse at times will have zero bearing on player signings.”Mills, the team president, has worked with Dolan on and off over the last two decades, and Perry is the general manager. They are the latest group that Dolan has entrusted to run the basketball side of the organization. (Others have included Isiah Thomas, Larry Brown, Donnie Walsh, Mike D’Antoni and Phil Jackson — all highly compensated and most of them successful elsewhere but unable to succeed under Dolan.)Dolan may be seen as the odious, impulsive and vengeful tyrant of the Garden, but Stern said Dolan desperately wanted a championship squad.“Jim has been on a crusade to get the best basketball people around him,” Stern said. “That’s what he thought he had with Phil and Isiah and Donnie, and what he thinks he has now with Steve and Scott.”But even with some of those well-respected men, Dolan was known to interfere in basketball decisions, particularly Walsh’s. Dolan has vowed to cease the meddling, and Mills says he has kept his word.“I keep him informed, but he does not get involved in what we do,” Mills said in a telephone interview last week.Dolan, however, did dictate to Mills which news outlets could be involved in some of Mills’s own news conferences. On two occasions this season, The Daily News, which Dolan and Madison Square Garden accused of being biased against them, was not invited, meaning Mills did not have total authority over everything to do with the Knicks."
Basketball,"The hiring of the W.N.B.A. point guard Kristi Toliver as a full-time assistant coach with the N.B.A.’s Washington Wizards while she is still an active player was widely applauded as a notable new achievement for women in coaching.It followed the San Antonio Spurs’ hiring of Becky Hammon, and other women like Nancy Lieberman and Jenny Boucek also joining N.B.A. coaching staffs.“With anything, you need to see it to be it,” said Briann January, a guard for the Phoenix Mercury and, in her off-season, an assistant women’s basketball coach at Arizona State. “I see it now because of Becky. Because of Kristi. I see the opportunity that is out there to take that next step in this professional area.”For many players, the moves showed N.B.A. teams tapping into a longstanding, significant pipeline of female talent.“I think a lot of women in general are missing out on a lot of good opportunities in which we can be extremely beneficial to any team, to any organization, no matter our gender,” said Alana Beard, a veteran Los Angeles Sparks guard often mentioned as a coaching candidate by her peers.Beard cited the meager pay Toliver is to receive this season — just $10,000 because of limits in the W.N.B.A.’s collective bargaining agreement — as an “extremely important” issue for the league to address in negotiations for a new agreement. The goal would be making a barrier that has long been permeable on one side — men into women’s basketball on the coaching side — into a free exchange of talent, regardless of gender, based on opportunity.Many, if not most, W.N.B.A. players, who are paid significantly less than their male counterparts, cannot afford to spend their off-season working for so little pay. Their basketball skills are worth much more — into the millions of dollars — in service of women’s leagues overseas.“All of those things on a coach’s plate to take care of, to do that for $10,000 for an entire N.B.A. season is crazy,” January said. “I’d like to break that down and do the math, like how much that is a game or how much that is a day. That would just be insult to injury.”Yet some people, including commentators on internet sites and men’s basketball fans in real life, contend these women should be happy to have opportunities at all.This attitude rankles many W.N.B.A. players — that even Toliver’s shot, let alone chances for other women with considerable experience playing and in many cases coaching, is often thought of as a one-sided benefit for those who are hired.But in many cases, the N.B.A. came calling after seeing the women excelling on their own. Toliver’s work with the Mystics helped bring her to the attention of Wizards Coach Scott Brooks, just as Hammon got her opportunity in San Antonio because she was employed by the Silver Stars, then owned by the same group as the Spurs, and her W.N.B.A. coach, Dan Hughes, talked her up to Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich.“I had a chance to put two parties together that I knew would work,” Hughes, now the head coach of the Seattle Storm, said. “I knew Becky, and I also knew Pop, and I knew that Pop, we had a lot of years of conversation about Becky. He had seen her play when I first brought her to San Antonio. So to me it was an opportunity to merge two people that would benefit from each other.”Toliver has opened up that discussion in significant ways, which she said was a large part of her reasoning for taking the job in the first place. In Hughes’s eyes, it is nothing less than the overdue elimination of whatever combination of sexism and inertia has prevented the men’s basketball world from taking advantage of all the talent amassed on the women’s side of the sport, the next step toward N.B.A. teams and W.N.B.A. teams and men’s and women’s college basketball programs all hiring from the same pool of candidates.As Hughes sees it, it’s time, not because these women deserve a chance, but because every basketball team needs more coaches like Hammon, Toliver and those who will follow.“I want a world someday where people judge coaches on how good a coach they truly are,” Hughes said. “Doesn’t matter if they’re male or female, doesn’t matter their background. They can say he’s a coach or she’s a coach, and we can use them.”"
Basketball,"Seven years ago, Tacko Fall and Christ Koumadje were discovered by basketball scouts in a similar fashion.They were hard to miss.On the streets of Dakar, Senegal, the two 7-footers stood out. They were spotted by employees of the Flying Star Academy, a Senegalese training ground for several basketball players who have ended up on college teams in the United States. The employees chased after the teenagers, imploring them to try their enormous hands at the sport.[Follow our live coverage of the N.C.A.A. tournament here.]At the time, Koumadje, now a 7-foot-4 senior at Florida State, preferred soccer. Fall, now a 7-foot-6 senior at Central Florida, was more interested in devouring anime and manga series like “Naruto” and “Tokyo Ghoul.” Both were, at first, indifferent to basketball.But their potential upside was difficult to ignore. To onlookers, they evoked thoughts of the next Hakeem Olajuwon or Yao Ming.Today, their size offers less promise. They toiled to become giant forces in the paint, only to watch as basketball evolved from a game that coveted height into a more freewheeling, 3-point-centric game that deems their skill sets nearly as obsolete as a fax machine: nice to have, but no longer entirely necessary.“What’s interesting about both, their advanced analytics, they play off the charts — well over 1 point per possession, and that’s really effective in college basketball,” said Steve Kyler, the editor and publisher of Basketball Insiders, which produces weekly N.B.A. mock drafts. “When you dig deeper, in situational-type things they grade really well, but the truth of the matter is the N.B.A. game isn’t played that way anymore. It’s all about stretch 5s, quickness.”“I think they may get a look on the fringe based off their size,” Kyler added. “But a guy 7-foot-6 being the first overall pick or top five is pretty rare now.”In the college game, where height can still create a tangible advantage, Fall and Koumadje — who are among the tallest players currently in Division I — will be crucial cogs in their teams’ N.C.A.A. tournament performance.Beyond that, whether they can find a place and purpose in the N.B.A. — where the only active players who stand 7-foot-3 or taller are Dallas’s Kristaps Porzingis, who has a far more diverse skill set, and Philadelphia’s Boban Marjanovic — remains to be seen.“Extending my range is something I definitely want to work on,” said Fall, who helped the Knights earn their first N.C.A.A. tournament berth since 2005 by averaging nearly 11 points and 7 rebounds a game. “I’m not going to go out there and shoot 3s like a lot of bigs do now, but pick my spots.“But I feel like no matter how the game has changed, you still need somebody down low to do some damage.”Basketball academies in Senegal like Flying Star now regularly send players abroad. After playing for a few months at the academy, Fall got a chance to join a high school team in the United States. His mother reluctantly let her son go, hoping he would receive a better education.Extremely raw when he arrived at Liberty Christian Preparatory School in Tavares, Fla., Fall almost quit basketball. But he refined his game while playing on a travel team alongside Ben Simmons, now with the Philadelphia 76ers. Fall also trained in Houston with Olajuwon, a Hall of Famer who emphasized the importance of footwork for a center his size."
Basketball,"LOS ANGELES — Hours after Magic Johnson abruptly resigned as the Los Angeles Lakers’ president of basketball operations, and mere minutes after LeBron James’s first season as the franchise cornerstone ended with a buzzer-beating loss, James left Staples Center on Tuesday night without speaking to reporters, trailed only by security officers and questions about the team’s future.It was not the season anyone envisioned for the Lakers, who had upended the N.B.A. by signing James last summer with the hype and expectation of returning the franchise to its glory years. One of the most storied teams in the league, the Lakers have not won a championship in nine years, and Los Angeles is frustrated, hungry and impatient.Instead, the team collected nearly as many injuries as losses. James, who will miss the N.B.A. playoffs beginning Saturday for the first time in 14 years, watched the final six games of the season from the bench as the team looked to preserve him for next season. His next buzzy stop is a studio lot as the star of “Space Jam 2,” which he has said is set to begin filming this summer.For the Lakers (37-45), all the drama was off the court, right up to the end, with Johnson’s abrupt announcement so out-of-the-blue that he had not even told his boss, the team owner Jeanie Buss, before wading into a gaggle of reporters.[Here is a look at Magic Johnson’s biggest moments as team president.]On Wednesday morning, Johnson, 59, wrote on Twitter that he considers himself a “Laker for life.”He announced in 1991 that he was H.I.V. positive but said Tuesday that he was in good health and it was not a factor in his decision.Johnson had sealed a $154 million, four-year deal for James — two greats fulfilling their needs: Johnson to restore luster to a glamorous team; James to close out his career as a Laker and develop his business and entertainment interests centered on Hollywood.And now they both left Staples Center with a losing record and a team in chaos.In some ways, it was the perfect finale to a season that trafficked in dysfunction.So there was the coach, Luke Walton, saying what losing coaches always say: essentially, wait until next year. His job may have been saved when Johnson quit, but he would not talk about that.“We have a lot of time to work and get better,” Walton said late Tuesday after the Lakers’ loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. “Let’s organize and prioritize what we need to do so we can give ourselves a better chance next season.”It was a wasted season for everyone involved, and James is as polarizing as ever, even in Los Angeles, where as much as fans banked on him, they also retained a degree of skepticism that this was all real.Jonas Never, a prominent Los Angeles-based street artist, found that out the hard way.“Honestly,” Never said in a telephone interview, “Lakers fans are the trickiest.”"
Basketball,"SACRAMENTO — The Boston Celtics were not in a good place when they boarded a plane bound for California on Sunday. They were coming off a home loss to the Houston Rockets that point guard Kyrie Irving punctuated by using a total of 43 words to answer nine questions in his postgame news conference.At one point, he was asked whether he thought the team could cobble together some momentum on its West Coast trip.“We’ll see,” he whispered.Just one season removed from a run to the N.B.A.’s Eastern Conference finals, and seemingly improved by the re-addition of Gordon Hayward and the continued development of their young core, the Celtics were on the brink of falling apart. Any hope they still harbored of being a championship-ready team was as brittle as a toothpick.But after some reflection and conversation, the Celtics regained a bit of their swagger with back-to-back wins this week against the Golden State Warriors and the Sacramento Kings. The Celtics will see if they can keep the good vibes going on Saturday against the Los Angeles Lakers, which is anything but certain, especially for Irving, whose season has been clouded by questions about his future with the team.Such uncertainty does not make Irving unique in the modern N.B.A. — Kevin Durant of the Warriors and Kawhi Leonard of the Toronto Raptors are among the other stars who will weigh big decisions in free agency this summer — but the Celtics have let the noise affect them.With the two wins this week improving their record to 40-26, the Celtics may be showing signs that they are finally, mercifully, learning how to cope.“That long plane ride helped us out,” Irving said after Tuesday’s lopsided victory over the Warriors. “I’ll just say that. We needed it. We needed it. We were going to get to a point where we were just going to get tired of fighting each other, fighting the outside world when it doesn’t really matter. So we just wanted to come out here and play basketball.“This is our sanctuary, and we have to do everything we can to protect it. We can’t let anyone infiltrate it.”Irving, who missed Wednesday’s win against the Kings with a left thigh contusion, is averaging a team-leading 23.4 points a game along with 7 assists and 4.9 rebounds, both career highs. He is also shooting 49.5 percent from the field and 41.7 percent from 3-point range.He also ranks among the N.B.A. leaders in mercurial behavior. He has been vague about the specific source of his discontent, but it may have something to do with his pending free agency.Irving backed off an earlier pledge to re-sign with the Celtics after they struggled at the start of the season. In fact, during a trip to New York to play the Knicks on Feb. 1, he told a group of reporters in his own colorfully abrasive way that he did not owe anyone anything. The Knicks, of course, would be interested in signing Irving, a six-time All-Star who grew up in New Jersey and has a soft spot for Madison Square Garden.Then came the All-Star break, and a clip of Irving and Durant having an inaudible conversation found its way to the internet, where an army of amateur lip readers tried to decode what they were saying. Worth noting: Irving and Durant are close friends. Also worth noting: The Knicks will have enough cap space this summer for two max contracts.Irving refused to shed light on their chat, and said it was nobody’s business, which was his prerogative. But it had the general effect of using a napkin to mop up an oil spill.Since then, Irving has been alluding to nefarious forces and the steep cost of celebrity, saying he hates the spotlight — even as he sells sneakers and moonlights as an actor. He reiterated his disdain this week after collecting 19 points and 11 assists against the Warriors, his 17th double-double this season."
Basketball,"The crush of bodies surrounding Dwyane Wade as he left an N.B.A. court for the last time as an active player had the effect of a small tidal wave, surging through the jammed Barclays Center tunnel, head-on into a pack of waiting well-wishers.At the rear of the crowd stood Pat Riley, who brought Wade to Miami 16 years ago, nurtured him to stardom, celebrated three championships with him, let him get away in 2016 over a contract dispute and less than two years later welcomed him home with open arms.“Whoa,” Riley said, hands on the shoulders of his wife, Chris, steadying her against the swell of humanity.Now here, finally, came Wade, man of the hour. Wade and Riley, both standing 6 feet 4 inches, made eye contact. Riley raised his right arm forward. Wade reached above the security detail, clasping his hand with the team president’s. The linchpins of the Miami Heat franchise pulled together for a heartfelt embrace.“One more,” Riley told Wade. “I’ve got a max contract for you.”Wade snickered. Riley chortled. It was the self-mocking joke Riley could tell and they both could enjoy after Wade, having gone home again following unfulfilling detours to Chicago and Cleveland, was given the send-off he deserved.After being traded back to Miami by the Cavaliers early last year, Wade talked himself into a last dance for the 2018-19 season, many nights of which he played younger than his well-worn 37 years. Properly feted before Miami’s home schedule closeout on Tuesday night, he scored 30 points in a victory over Philadelphia and topped it off with a playful triple double (25 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists) as the Heat’s season ended 24 hours later with a 113-94 defeat to the playoff-bound Nets.“I can retire and be happy about my career,” Wade would say, sporting a gold and black jacket in the interview room, on his way out to dance the night away with a guest list that included his N.B.A. “brotherhood” — LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul.However dapper at 74, with a fine head of combed-back gray hair, Riley was never part of that social scene, just the patriarch who landed Wade with the fifth pick of the 2003 draft, considered at the time to be a consolation prize after James, Darko Milicic, Anthony and Chris Bosh were the first four players chosen.But Wade was more special than anyone imagined during his time at Marquette, a world-class gymnast in basketball footwear, with the uncommon calm of a cocksure gunslinger.When Wade had moved on into the corridor leading to the locker room, I told Riley about a 2005 playoff night in Auburn Hills, Mich., when Wade, as a second-year player, was making life quite difficult for the defending champion, defensively stout Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals.Taking a halftime stroll, I ran into Chuck Daly, who as the Pistons coach in the late 1980s had devised a defense specifically for Michael Jordan — the famous Jordan Rules.“I’ll tell you what, he’s got some Jordan in him,” Daly said, dragging on a cigarette, when I asked what he thought of the young Wade. “He’s got all the things you can’t teach.”Riley nodded. “Chuck was right,” he said.Wade had other elite qualities besides the balletic ability to score from angles we couldn’t be sure actually existed. He could pass like a point guard when his team needed an assist. He was a solid team defender. He retires as the most productive shot-blocking guard in N.B.A. history, having last month nudged past Jordan."
Basketball,"HOUSTON — DeMarcus Cousins used to watch soap operas with his grandmother when he was growing up. She would refer to them as her “stories,” he said, and “As the World Turns” was her favorite. Cousins could never fully relate to the absurd drama of his grandmother’s stories until this season, when he joined the Golden State Warriors.“Every episode it was something,” he said. “And that’s what this has turned into.”Cousins is sometimes an innocent bystander. (Consider the midseason beef between Kevin Durant and Draymond Green that stemmed from a late-game meltdown against the Los Angeles Clippers and bled into Durant’s impending free agency.) But sometimes Cousins is involved, even if it is not his choice. He was aware, for example, before Wednesday’s game against the Houston Rockets, that members of the news media and the general public were picking apart his defense and referring to him as a liability.“We all been in this business long enough to know how it goes,” said Cousins, a 6-foot-11 center. “And I’ve been around this team to know how things go around here. You’re always looking for something to make a story. I mean, I could care less. You all got to do your jobs, and I got to do mine.”For all the laments about Cousins’s vulnerability in pick-and-roll defensive situations, there is no denying his offensive impact when he is focused, and he was supremely focused against the Rockets on Wednesday night, collecting 27 points, 8 rebounds and 7 assists in a 106-104 victory that infused the team with some positive vibes.Scoring down low, passing out of the post, setting meaty screens — Cousins does things that the Warriors have seldom featured in their four-plus seasons of dominance.“For as long as we can remember, we haven’t had a guy we can just throw the ball to in the post and work around him,” Stephen Curry said.It is still a process, of course, both for the Warriors, who are working to incorporate another mammoth personality into their fold as they pursue a third straight championship, and for Cousins, a four-time All-Star who spent the first few months of the season building strength and working on his conditioning as he recovered from an Achilles’ tendon tear.Since Cousins made his season debut on Jan. 18, the Warriors are 15-7. But they had lost six of their last 10 games entering Wednesday, and the general mood of the team felt flat. Curry likened it to when Durant joined the Warriors in 2016, and the team spent the first two or three months of the season trying to find its rhythm.“There was a little sensitivity to how everybody was going to get their shots,” Curry said. “At the end of the day, we’re all talented and we all have high basketball I.Q.s, so just let things happen. You don’t have to force anything. We’ve been good at it at times, and not so good at other times. So it’s just a matter of sticking with the program.”After sinking 11 of 16 shots against the Rockets, Cousins acknowledged that it was the best he had felt since he made his return.“I think it’s coming,” Cousins said. “We’ve had stretches where it’s kind of flowing for everybody. But this is a team that’s been together for a while, and they’re used to playing a certain type of way. So for me to just come in — I’m not expecting this team to adjust to me. Obviously, I have to adjust to them.”Durant missed the game with a sprained ankle, which meant that Cousins had more playmaking opportunities than usual. Coach Steve Kerr made some adjustments, too, staggering Cousins and Green for stretches so that each had more room to operate in the middle of the court. Kerr has also been advising his players to pump the brakes in transition.“Sometimes we’ve played a little too fast and shot too many quick shots instead of letting him get down on the block and controlling things,” Kerr said, referring to Cousins. He added: “I think we’ve got to remind ourselves that this is still early in the process. We’re all learning. Me too. I’ve got to learn to use him better.”If Cousins still appears to labor at times (or most of the time) to get overly airborne, his confidence seems fine."
Basketball,"Kenny Anderson, a celebrated point guard from Queens who had a 14-year N.B.A. career, was hospitalized over the weekend after suffering a stroke.Lina Catalfamo Plath, a family spokeswoman, said via email that Anderson was recovering. Plath also released a statement from Anderson’s wife, Natasha.“We would like to thank everyone for reaching out on behalf of Kenny,” Natasha Anderson said in the statement. “Our family is extremely grateful for all the prayers and love that we have received over the last few days. We appreciate you continuing to respect our privacy as Kenny heals.”Anderson, 48, recently concluded his first season as the men’s basketball coach at Fisk University, a historically black school in Nashville that plays at the N.A.I.A. level.As a high school player at Archbishop Molloy, a powerhouse program in Queens, Anderson was one of the most prolific and high-profile players in the city’s rich basketball history. A McDonald’s All-American, Anderson set what was then a state scoring record with 2,621 points before enrolling at Georgia Tech, where he helped the team reach the Final Four in 1990.After Anderson spent two seasons at Georgia Tech, the New Jersey Nets made him the second overall pick in the 1991 N.B.A. draft — Larry Johnson went first to the Charlotte Hornets — and Anderson enjoyed a productive career that never quite lived up to the hype that had followed him since he was a teenager. He averaged 12.6 points and 6.1 assists a game while playing for nine teams, including the Boston Celtics and the Portland Trail Blazers, and was an All-Star selection for the Nets in 1994.A 2017 documentary on Anderson called “Mr. Chibbs” detailed many of his personal struggles, including bankruptcy and depression. In 2014, he traveled to North Korea as a member of the team that Dennis Rodman, the former Chicago Bulls forward, cobbled together at the invitation of Kim Jong-un, the country’s leader.“My mistakes weren’t really mistakes,” Anderson said in an interview with The New York Times in 2011. “It was being young and living and learning. Yes, I spent a lot of money; I went through a lot of money. I had some failed marriages — if you want to criticize me for that. You can’t cry about your mishaps. I count my blessings, I don’t count my mishaps.”"
Basketball,"Mike Bibby, the former N.B.A. player, is being investigated by the police over accusations of sexual abuse.Mr. Bibby, now a high school basketball coach in Arizona, was accused by a teacher who works at the same school, The Arizona Republic reported. The episode that prompted the accusations was said to have taken place in 2017.The Republic, citing a restraining order granted last week, said that Mr. Bibby had been accused of grabbing the teacher by the waist and pulling her into a car, then groping her and rubbing his genitals on her. After the woman left the car, the order said, he followed her and made sexual remarks. The woman said she did not know Mr. Bibby before the incident.The restraining order quoted the teacher as saying she was “in shock, in fear, intimidated by his actions, afraid of him as he smelled of alcohol.”A lawyer for Mr. Bibby denied the accusations.“I can say with pretty much certainty this alleged incident didn’t happen and that will be shown down the road,” Donald Harris, Mr. Bibby’s lawyer, told The Republic. “Michael Bibby did not participate in a sexual assault of any way, shape or form that was alleged by this lady two years ago.”Mr. Bibby recently coached the boys’ basketball team to a fourth straight state championship at the school, Shadow Mountain High in Phoenix. He is also an alumnus of Shadow Mountain, and won a state championship as a player in the 1990s before attending the University of Arizona, where he won a national championship in 1997. He retired from the N.B.A. in 2012 after a 14-year career with six teams, most notably the Vancouver Grizzlies, Sacramento Kings and Atlanta Hawks. He spent his last season with the Knicks, playing 39 games after signing as a free agent in December 2011.For the past two summers, Mr. Bibby, 40, played with the Ghost Ballers of the Big3, a professional 3-on-3 basketball league founded by the rapper Ice Cube."
Basketball,"DENVER — There was a time not long ago that basketball success in the Rocky Mountains was measured by the Denver Nuggets’ ability to persuade a free agent of Dwyane Wade’s stature to meet team brass in New York and let the Nuggets offer him millions.In the summer of 2016, only one season into the career of Nikola Jokic and with few hints to that point that the Nuggets already had a cornerstone player, just getting the opportunity to pitch Wade face-to-face was widely hailed as a triumph for this franchise.What went unrevealed that off-season was that Denver also made a futile run at Wade’s longtime rival, Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks. Nowitzki had no interest in even entertaining the idea of leaving the only team he had ever known, but that was the Nuggets in the embryonic stages of Jokic’s development — straining to persuade some of the game’s biggest names to take them seriously.Three years later, Jokic is a certifiable All-Star and his team of upstarts from the Mile High City found an entertaining way on Tuesday night to win some leaguewide notice. Seemingly headed for a second consecutive playoff defeat to the San Antonio Spurs on its home floor, Denver rode a remarkable fourth-quarter resurrection from the third-year guard Jamal Murray to rally to a 114-105 victory over the Spurs that did far more than even this Western Conference first-round series at one game apiece.“Definitely saved the season,” Paul Millsap, Denver’s veteran forward, said in a quiet moment at his locker. “To go down, 0-2, against the San Antonio Spurs, going into their place, it’s a massacre waiting to happen.”Millsap’s candor conveyed a good chunk of the significance attached to this win, but not all of it. Murray’s eruption for 21 of his 24 points in the final period — on 8-for-9 shooting after he stood at 0-for-8 through three quarters — not only gave the hosts hope of making this an actual series but also spared them some real embarrassment and introspection.After five consecutive seasons out of the playoffs, Denver unexpectedly won 54 games this season to vault to No. 2 in the West. The Nuggets were nonetheless a trendy pick to suffer a first-round upset against the San Antonio masters of execution and their coaching maestro, Gregg Popovich, which would naturally render Denver’s regular-season accomplishments rather hollow.“Frauds” was the popular word being tossed around on N.B.A. Twitter after the Nuggets fell behind by 19 points — twice — in a must-win game. Booing broke out at Pepsi Center on multiple occasions in just Denver’s second home playoff game since 2013, with both Jokic and Nuggets Coach Michael Malone telling reporters afterward that the fans were too hard on Will Barton when they hissed at his 1-for-10 shooting.“When they’re going through a tough time, they could use some love,” Malone said of his players, who comprise the league’s youngest playoff roster.Fortunately for Barton and the rest of the Nuggets, it was all love in the fourth quarter, thanks largely to Murray, who shot 8-for-24 in Game 1 — including a wide-open elbow jumper he clanked in crunchtime that clearly haunted the Canadian guard well into Game 2.During one key timeout, Malone reminded his players “what the Clippers did” Monday night, when they rallied out of a 31-point deficit in the second half at Golden State to register the largest playoff comeback in N.B.A. history. The inspiration finally hit Murray in the fourth when, without warning, he drained his first eight shots.In support of Murray, Jokic rang up 21 points, 13 rebounds and 8 assists in a bid for a second consecutive triple-double, which would suggest that the Serbian big man is coping quite well with his first turn under a playoff microscope. Gary Harris and Millsap added 23 and 20 points, to give Denver four starters in the 20s.“We gave up 38 points in the fourth quarter,” said a seething Popovich. “End of story.”The collapse was even worse than Popovich realized. The Spurs actually allowed 39 points in the quarter — and San Antonio’s All-Star forward, LaMarcus Aldridge, could be subjected to some league discipline that affects his status for Thursday night’s Game 3 judging by video footage in circulation that appears to show Aldridge landing a below-the-belt shot on Harris.Not that the Nuggets, after days of hearing incessantly about how inexperienced they are, can feel any sort of comfort yet. They’ve lost 13 consecutive games in San Antonio dating to 2012. Denver is also 0-11, as a franchise, in best-of-seven series after losing Game 1."
Basketball,"Cal Ramsey, a presence on the New York basketball scene for more than a half-century, who starred at New York University in the 1950s, played briefly for the Knicks and remained with them as a longtime broadcaster and community relations representative, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 81.The Knicks announced his death, at a rehabilitation center. He had been in poor health in recent years.Ramsey, who had lived in Harlem since he was young, began honing his skills on the playground courts of the Rucker League, which has attracted some of the game’s greatest players over the years.He first appeared at Madison Square Garden while playing for Commerce High School of Manhattan. He played at the Garden for three seasons as a forward at N.Y.U., where he was a teammate of the future Boston Celtic forward Tom Sanders. He is 11th on the leading scorers list for N.Y.U. with 1,275 points.Ramsey was selected in the second round of the 1959 N.B.A. draft by the St. Louis Hawks. At 6 feet 4 inches, he was an outstanding rebounder with a good shooting touch, but he came to be considered too small as a forward and not good enough as a dribbler to excel at guard.He played in only four games with the Hawks and seven with the Knicks in the 1959-60 season, then in two games with the Syracuse Nationals, the forerunners of the Philadelphia 76ers, in 1960-61.Ramsey may have faced another obstacle in the N.B.A. that had little to do with his skills. “I’ve been told at the time there was a quota system in the league,” in which teams “may have wanted only two or three blacks,” Ramsey told Charles Salzberg for the oral history “From Set Shot to Slam Dunk” (1987).After Ramsey’s stint with Syracuse, he went to the semipro Eastern League but incurred a severe knee injury in his third season with the circuit. It ended his playing career.Ramsey was born on July 13, 1937, in Selma, Ala. He was a teacher in New York after his playing days, having received a bachelor’s degree from N.Y.U.He was a color analyst for Knicks broadcasts from 1972 to 1982, then rejoined the team as a community representative in 1991. He was also an assistant basketball coach at N.Y.U., which had become a Division III team, from 1983 until the past season. He served N.Y.U. as assistant director of community relations for 20 years and received the N.Y.U. President’s Alumni Achievement Award in 2004.Information on his survivors was not immediately available.James L. Dolan, the Knicks’ owner, said in a statement that Ramsey “will be remembered for the thousands of young lives he influenced as a community leader.”A case in point involved Al Barden, who, after starring for Boys High School in Brooklyn (now Boys and Girls), was recruited to N.Y.U. by Ramsey while he was playing there.“Al was a tough kid with a habit of getting into some trouble,” Ramsey told Harvey Araton of The New York Times in 2009. “So I stayed on him, made sure he was going to class, doing the things he needed to stay eligible.”When Barden’s basketball career was over, Ramsey, mindful of the problems athletes have in transitioning to a new phase of life, hired Barden as his replacement to direct a high school program for at-risk students. They remained friends through the years."
Basketball,"LONDON — In theory at least, we understand the words on the sports radio we hear incessantly — in taxis, at the fish and chips place, at the corner newsstand. But we are foreigners here and the stories are inscrutable, full of happenings from cricket ovals and rugby pitches.Our sports focus is confined to our darkened living room, where my 7-year-old son, Leo, and I have lately been absorbing improbable happenings from the other side of the Atlantic — one exhilarating victory after another for our suddenly mighty Brooklyn Nets.This has become our early-morning ritual. Wife and daughter still asleep, the boys watch the action from the night before, the scores carefully hidden from our N.B.A. League Pass app lest we ruin the ending.We are basketball expatriates, two steps removed from the initial source of my N.B.A. obsession by a change of team loyalties and a move to London.In our North London surroundings, we may as well be rooting for a badminton team from Bhutan. While the odd LeBron James jersey can be spotted, our Brooklyn Nets gear seemingly fades into the sea of Yankees caps brought home by tourists returning from New York (oblivious to the hate they are inspiring from this Mets fan) and the endless Brooklyn-related mumbo jumbo that now adorns T-shirts worldwide.[Nets’ Run to the Playoffs Hits a Snag With Spencer Dinwiddie Injury]While N.F.L. gear is a common sighting, owing to the constant staging of American football games here, N.B.A. basketball is largely invisible. One imagines this was unaltered by the recent showdown of two of the league’s most dreadful teams, the Knicks and the Washington Wizards, inside London’s unlovable O2 arena. (We did not attend, just as we do not take leisure trips to see the dentist.)Our sports-related conversations with Britons tend to revolve around the astronomical ticket prices required to see Arsenal, the English Premier League soccer team Leo has decided that we love forever. Our Nets fandom is like membership in a secret society, whose disclosure would mark us as eccentric and produce puzzlement.Even my Knick fan friends back in New York do not want to hear about the Nets via email. My only real communion comes via obscure Nets-related podcasts I listen to while washing the dishes. When Bill Simmons and Zach Lowe devoted perhaps 3 minutes of a recent pod to the Nets surge, I confess to feelings of pride and validation I can only liken to a U.F.O. conspiracy theorist hearing that the government is probing the sighting of a flying saucer.My embrace of the Nets began seven years ago when the Knicks — the only team I had ever rooted for — shunned a gift from the basketball gods by letting Jeremy Lin leave town. It was the final indignity after years of atrocious basketball. I dumped my Knicks season tickets and adopted the fledgling club whose arena had just risen over my Brooklyn neighborhood.I did not do so lightly. As a born-and-bred New Yorker, I saw abandoning a team as a serious breach of the tribal code. I disdained fans from other cities who rooted for two teams in the same sport. I was unremittingly harsh to the worst transgressor of all: the bandwagon fan. (If that Steph Curry jersey you own was the first Warriors gear in your closet, yes, I’m talking about you.)But I was hopping on no bandwagon. With the exception of a pair of distant trips to the N.B.A. finals, the New Jersey-turned-Brooklyn Nets were a pathetic franchise. I was living in Brooklyn. My father had grown up in Queens and traveled on a streetcar to watch the Dodgers at Ebbets Field. I was not abandoning my tribe. I was returning to it.This is what I told myself as I began reading about the odd collection of players I was now rooting for, trying to divine the narrative that would make it real. I fought through a sense of exile in the slick, new Barclays Center, which was full of fans for whom the game itself appeared peripheral to the cool Brooklyn food, the dancing during timeouts, and whatever fascinating things were happening on their phones.Yes, it was a gorgeous arena with excellent sightlines and welcoming staff. The season tickets I bought the day the Knicks said goodbye to J-Lin put me in seats that were a 10-minute walk from my house in Prospect Heights. Madison Square Garden was a cramped dump reached via a creaking subway and a walk through the bowels of Penn Station.Yet there was something about the Garden, even as the Dolan era yielded a lost decade of basketball. The crowd understood. Hustle plays drew appreciation in an arena that had revered Charles Oakley. The energy was electric."
Basketball,"Louisiana State suspended its head men’s basketball coach, Will Wade, on Friday — less than two weeks before the N.C.A.A. tournament is set to begin — after a report that Wade made damning remarks to a recruiting middleman on a phone call that was wiretapped as part of a federal corruption investigation.Wade spoke with Christian Dawkins, who was convicted of fraud last year for his connection in a scheme to funnel money to the families of basketball recruits, in violation of N.C.A.A. rules. In the conversation, according to a report on Thursday by Yahoo Sports, Wade was heard boasting in colorful language that he had made a strong offer to one recruit but that he had not yet committed because someone else in his life was not getting “enough piece of the pie in the deal.”A source with knowledge of the call, who declined to be identified because the trial is continuing, confirmed the report on Friday.The No. 10 Tigers (25-5) are having their best season in decades and are considered shoo-ins for an N.C.A.A. tournament bid. They host Vanderbilt on Saturday night before next week’s Southeastern Conference tournament in Nashville.“All of us at L.S.U. share the obligation to protect the integrity of this institution,” said the university’s president, F. King Alexander, and its athletic director, Joe Alleva, in a statement. “As such, we have suspended Head Coach Will Wade indefinitely until such time as we can ensure full compliance with the N.C.A.A., as well as institutional policies and standards.”Alexander and Alleva pledged full cooperation with the N.C.A.A. and said an assistant coach, Tony Benford, would be interim head coach.When confronted with the report on Thursday by a local television station, Wade declined to comment.Dawkins was convicted of fraud after a trial last year, alongside Jim Gatto, the former director of global sports marketing for Adidas, and Merl Code Jr., who had also worked for Adidas. After a yearslong investigation involving a cooperating witness, undercover agents and wiretaps, prosecutors said the men had conspired to funnel Adidas money to the family of a top basketball player who would play for Louisville, one of the most prominent teams the apparel giant sponsors.But prosecutors also accused Dawkins and Code of involvement in bribing assistant coaches at top programs. In a trial set to begin next month, three assistant coaches have pleaded guilty, but Dawkins and Code are also defendants and, following sentencing in the first trial on Tuesday, their lawyers pledged to fight prosecutors on the facts and summon college coaches to testify.When the charges were first announced, in September 2017, they swiftly led to the firings of Louisville’s athletic director and Hall of Fame coach, Rick Pitino. Several assistant coaches charged also lost their jobs. Arizona Coach Sean Miller was suspended for a game after a report that he was on tape discussing with Dawkins the payment of $100,000 to a top recruit, but he and the university denied the charge and he was reinstated. Evidence at last year’s trial indicated that Miller did have phone calls with Dawkins.“The information in recent news reports is very disturbing, if true,” the SEC commissioner, Greg Sankey, said in a statement on Friday. “Considering the existing circumstances, L.S.U. has taken appropriate action today while the investigation continues.”"
Basketball,"Nathaniel Butler has been an N.B.A. senior photographer since 1984. Those were the days of shooting on film and developing photos in hotel rooms after games. Today, players text Butler as they arrive at the arena so he can be in position to capture a perfect arena entrance shot for them to post on Instagram.The job isn’t what it used to be.When Andrew D. Bernstein became an official N.B.A. photographer in 1986, he was continually thwarted in his attempts to get his camera into in-game huddles to capture the interactions between players and coaches. Pat Riley, who was the coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, made sure to obscure all viewpoints.Halfway through the season, Riley asked Bernstein why he wanted to be in the huddle. People want to see what’s happening on the inside, Bernstein told Riley, who agreed to give Bernstein a chance. If you screw up, Riley said, you are never coming back.More than three decades later, Bernstein is still photographing N.B.A. players, huddles and pretty much whatever he pleases as the league’s longest tenured senior photographer.Photographers have long played a critical role in shaping narratives in a league defined by faces and moments. The most iconic posters are the finished works of the photographers who position themselves along the baseline each game, often contorting their bodies and forgetting about personal comfort to get closer and take countless snaps, in hopes of capturing a masterpiece.In today’s N.B.A., they allow players to use those photographs as building blocks for their social media profiles. They have adapted to an ever-changing digital world that has presented new opportunities and a whole new set of challenges.On game day, Butler uses a combination of tethered remotes and custom phone apps to operate any number of cameras in an arena.He sends photographs to a team of editors in Secaucus, N.J., with the press of a button. In seconds, they can be published on the league’s official social media feeds and reach millions of people around the world.Despite the technological advances, shooting an N.B.A. game can be more difficult than one would think. “A basketball game is a complex situation,” said Bruce Ely, the lead photographer of the Portland Trail Blazers. “There are a lot of moving parts.”Like a fan’s arms waving across the frame just as Damian Lillard makes a 3-pointer. Or the leg of another player sneaking into the edge of the image, ruining a portrait. Another time, it might be a referee walking into a perfect shot.Despite the challenges, some N.B.A. photographers do not consider it their most difficult assignment. Nelson Campana, who photographs the Raptors as an employee of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, which owns the team, regularly shoots weddings as well. The pressure of game night is nothing compared with the responsibility of chronicling a couple’s special day.“You have one night to make it right,” Campana said. “There’s a list of things you need to get, and you don’t get another chance. At a basketball game, you’re just hoping things happen.”Some nights, there is too much happening at the same time. As the Oklahoma City Thunder eliminated the San Antonio Spurs in the 2016 playoffs, Butler had to make a split-second decision about what to photograph at the buzzer. He focused on Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook embracing, and then got a shot of Durant with Tim Duncan. He stayed with Durant afterward, but that meant missing a chance to capture Duncan walking off an N.B.A. court for the final time.“Ideally,” Butler said, “I would like to be in two places at one time.”"
Basketball,"An Alabama girl’s banishment from high school basketball came to an end on Friday morning when a circuit court judge accomplished what appeals to state boards and outcries from some of the most prominent voices in sports could not.After the parents of Maori Davenport filed a motion on Thursday to get their daughter back on the basketball court, Judge Sonny Reagan of Pike County Circuit Court ruled that Davenport could return to competition pending a hearing. He will decide whether she deserved to be ruled ineligible for accepting a mistaken payment from the sport’s national governing body for playing on a junior national team last summer.The effect will be almost immediate. Davenport, 18, a star forward at Charles Henderson High School in Troy, Ala., was set to play with her team on Friday night against Carroll High School.Last season, Davenport averaged 18.2 points, 12.2 rebounds and 5.2 blocks a game in leading Charles Henderson to the Alabama Class 5A state title. The year before, in a losing effort in the state title game, she had 20 points and 25 rebounds and swatted away 19 shots, an Alabama state record. She has committed to play at Rutgers.Her athletic eligibility became a cause célèbre in the past week. On Nov. 30, Davenport, a 6-foot-4 forward, was called into her principal’s office and told that the Alabama High School Athletic Association had ruled her ineligible for one year, her senior season.The suspension was not for poor grades or unsportsmanlike conduct. It was because of a clerical error that U.S.A. Basketball, the sport’s national governing body, readily admitted to having made, and the decision to suspend her became one of the more mind-boggling stories for those who follow amateur sports.“That was very heartbreaking for me,” Davenport said this week of the suspension. “The only thing I could think is that I was in shock and devastated.”The trouble began harmlessly enough over the summer, when Davenport represented the United States at the FIBA Under-18 Women’s Americas Championship in Mexico City. She led the team in rebounding and blocks as it won gold.U.S.A. Basketball compensates players who compete on national teams to make up for wages they could have earned working summer jobs rather than practicing or competing. The N.C.A.A. allows college athletes to accept those payments. It calls them broken-time payments.For players with high school eligibility remaining, U.S.A. Basketball typically inquires with individual state high school athletics associations to see if the payments can be accepted. Policies can vary by state.In this case, because of what Craig Miller, a spokesman for U.S.A. Basketball, termed a clerical error, nobody checked with the state high school athletic associations for the three players on the under-18 team with high school eligibility remaining. U.S.A. Basketball sent checks for $857.20 to Davenport and every other player on the team. On Aug. 27, Mario Davenport, Maori’s father, received it. Two days later, she cashed it.Two months later, U.S.A. Basketball realized the error. In November, an employee called the Alabama athletics association, which told the U.S.A. Basketball employee that under Alabama rules, athletes could accept broken-time payments only if the value was less than $200. On Nov. 26, a U.S.A. Basketball official called Davenport’s mother, Tara Davenport, and informed her that Maori was not allowed to accept the stipend. The next day, Tara Davenport reported the violation to the state association and informed Charles Henderson High School officials, and on Nov. 28 she repaid U.S.A. Basketball.Two days later, the state ruled Davenport ineligible for the rest of the season. Two appeals boards have upheld the ruling.On Wednesday afternoon, Tara Davenport said she hoped attention from the news media, as well as pressure from Alabama politicians, would convince the association to change the ruling. The Alabama House Republican Caucus unanimously approved a resolution supporting Maori Davenport, and its members were among the many local politicians supporting her. If the association’s officials were unwilling to change their ruling, Tara Davenport was prepared to take the next step.“If they don’t, we are definitely going to take some legal action to try to help get her on the court,” she said. The next day, she and Mario Davenport filed a lawsuit in Pike County Circuit Court seeking their daughter’s reinstatement."
Basketball,"Sometime in the third quarter, as the Philadelphia 76ers rained down 3-pointers like mortar shots and Ben Simmons, a giant point guard possessed of preternatural passing ability and a bricklayer’s touch, carved through the Nets, a thought occurred:This was not the playoff homecoming of the Nets’ dreams.The Nets tried but never really contended Thursday night. The men from Philadelphia simply had too much talent and too many big bodies on their way to a 2-1 first-round series lead, and that was a shame. Saddled with the worst attendance in the N.B.A. this season, Barclays Center in Brooklyn was packed to the gills with fans waving towels and hooting and yelling. The joint was packed and joyfully rocking.The Nets are a pretty good pro hoops team in a city where terrible often rules the roost. Their coach, Kenny Atkinson, a likable and intelligent basketball lifer, took over a team that was expected to dwell in the cellar and won more games, 42, than it lost, 40, this season.That was in contrast to the disaster masquerading as a basketball team at Madison Square Garden, where the Knicks’ management team crafted a grotesquely bad team that finished 17-65. (Losing no longer impresses because the Knicks have posted losing records in 15 of the last 18 years.) In a sign that God may have a strange sense of humor, those same Knicks are widely rumored to be a favorite to gain the services of the brilliant forward Kevin Durant, who can become a free agent this summer.But enough about that other New York team.After falling into a deep ditch under previous management, the Brooklyn Nets have executed a slow, steady rebuild, instilling discipline and a sense of Nets basketball, which is to say a fluid, slashing style that relies on small forwards and guards bolstered by lean, swift centers who block shots and rebound and run. Their general manager, Sean Marks, a former San Antonio Spurs assistant and executive, has picked up talented role players much as a fishmonger sorts through a barrel and plucks out tasty sea bass.The Nets have a fine quartet of guards and small forwards, D’Angelo Russell and Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris and Caris LeVert, creative players all, who can probe and find seams in defenses and stroke jump shots.So this game on Thursday offered a chance to draw the measure of a Nets team rising more quickly than expected and of a Sixers team that hopes to compete for a championship. On that last point I walked away nursing doubts.The Sixers for six years were an experimental laboratory, their former general manager Sam Hinkie occupying a reputational land between supposed genius and madman. They lost intentionally and insistently, and accumulated top draft picks, not the least the 6-foot-10 point guard Simmons and the splendidly talented big man Joel Embiid. Sixers ownership eventually discarded Hinkie. But that team now is expected to contend, and the current general manager made a series of trades toward that end this season.Yet a week into playoff season, the engine of that 76ers machine is coughing. Embiid has come up with a chronically sore knee. That is a problem for any athlete, much less a 7-foot, 270-pound center. The assumption Thursday night was that he would play, an impression reinforced when Embiid took the court an hour before the game and shot around. He shot fadeaways and spun like a dervish and put up graceful hook shots.Then minutes before tipoff, the 76ers’ coaches shook their heads. Nope, his knee was too sore. Embiid was sitting. That left the big man in a bad mood. Moments before the tip, as teammates walked over to dap him up and slap his back, Embiid could barely look at them or the court.Simmons is no less talented, and perhaps more baffling. He is a brilliant athlete with stunning vision and dribbling ability. When he breaks swiftly into the open court, his passing takes on a sleight-of-hand quality, so quick that you notice the ball only as it lands in the hands of a teammate.Alas, his shooting edges toward disastrous, and his confidence in it is sodden. Rather than put his hand under the ball, he puts it off to the side, his left elbow sticking out like a chicken wing. He practices his shooting before games with often unsightly results. On Thursday evening, he stood in the corner and took pass after pass from an assistant coach and shot and shot. He made, by my count, five baskets in 15 attempts. Then he took 3-point shots from the shoulder of the key, going 1 for 6.You wanted to cover your eyes and suggest that maybe he should stick to layups. Yet by shooting layups and hook shots and dunks, he finished the game with 31 points and 9 assists."
Basketball,"The woman who has accused Virginia’s lieutenant governor, Justin E. Fairfax, of raping her said that a former N.B.A. player, Corey Maggette, raped her at Duke University 20 years ago and that school officials did not pursue the claim, according to a childhood friend of the woman and Facebook messages the woman exchanged with another friend.Mr. Maggette, who attended Duke for one year, 1998-99, and reached the national championship game, played in the N.B.A. until 2013 and has since worked as a television analyst for Fox Sports.Mr. Maggette denied the accusation through a spokesman Monday evening. “It has only been through media accounts and a statement from Meredith Watson’s lawyer that I first learned or heard of anything about these sexual assault allegations,” Mr. Maggette said in a statement. “I have never sexually assaulted anyone in my life and I completely and categorically deny any such charge.”A spokeswoman for Fox Sports West, where Mr. Maggette is a basketball analyst, said in an email, “Fox Sports takes allegations of misconduct seriously, and we are looking into the matter. We have no further comment at this time.”Nancy Erika Smith, the lawyer for the woman who accused Mr. Maggette and Mr. Fairfax, Meredith Watson, said in a statement Friday that Ms. Watson had been raped by a Duke basketball player during her sophomore year but did not name the player. Ms. Smith also said that Ms. Watson had reported her rape to an unspecified dean at the university, but that the dean had “discouraged her from pursuing the claim further.”Duke has acknowledged it is investigating an allegation that a player raped the woman, but a spokesman for the university declined to comment on the identity of the player or the assertion that the university failed to act on the accusation.“We are in the process of gathering information to determine what policies and procedures were in place during the time period in which these events are alleged to have occurred, and whether they were activated and followed,” said Michael Schoenfeld, a spokesman for Duke. “We are not able to provide further information or comment on any individual at this time.”Years before Ms. Watson came forward as the second woman to publicly accuse Mr. Fairfax of sexual assault, inflaming a political crisis in Virginia, she told multiple friends that she had been raped by Mr. Maggette, according to one of those friends and Facebook messages exchanged with another.R. Stanton Jones, a partner at the law firm Arnold & Porter in Washington who grew up with Ms. Watson in Baltimore, said she told him that she had been raped by Mr. Maggette. She told Mr. Jones about it while he and Ms. Watson were both home for the summer in 2001, he said.“Meredith told me she had been raped twice at Duke,” Mr. Jones said. “And she told me that one of the men who raped her was the Duke basketball player Corey Maggette. That was a name I knew because I’m a basketball fan.”Mr. Jones, who did not attend Duke, said he had not had much contact with Ms. Watson in the last decade “other than occasionally liking a Facebook post.” He said he was coming forward now because it “seemed like the right thing to do.”The longtime coach of Duke’s men’s basketball team, Mike Krzyzewski, said after his team’s victory against Virginia on Saturday night that he had “no knowledge” of the situation and that he had learned of it only from news media reports Friday.Karen Kessler, a spokeswoman for Ms. Watson, provided The New York Times with a Facebook message exchange between Ms. Watson and a friend from March 2017. Ms. Kessler declined to identify the friend, whose name was blacked out in the messages, and The Times was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the messages.In the messages, Ms. Watson expressed disgust at a newspaper article written about Mr. Fairfax, who had already announced his bid for lieutenant governor. After the friend asked Ms. Watson whether she had reported the rape, Ms. Watson responded: “You know I didn’t report it after how the university responded when I reported Corey Maggette.”Ms. Kessler said that after being discouraged by the dean, Ms. Watson decided not to report her accusation to the police."
Basketball,"I was 8 years old when my parents — both graduate students from India — moved from married student housing to a little home in Raleigh, N.C., with a basketball hoop in the backyard. Even as an immigrant from South Asia, I knew what that hoop meant.Basketball is a religion in North Carolina, and I quickly became a disciple. When I was 11, the N.C. State Wolfpack won the N.C.A.A. championship in heart-stopping fashion. I still remember my dad taking me to the center of campus for the midnight celebration and being transfixed by the sheer size and emotion of it.My love for the game soon became an obsession. I taught myself to shoot in the backyard and played against the neighborhood kids. I learned to make up for my disadvantages on the court — both real (I’m definitely undersized) and perceived (no one expected a short Indian kid to be any good) — through hustle and perfecting a low left-handed heave that I used whenever I could beat my man into the lane.My crowning achievement came in the final seconds of a Little League championship game, when I went to the free-throw line with my team down a point. Both shots clanked around the rim but went in.In college, watching the sport became equally addictive — especially now that I was at UNC-Chapel Hill. My senior year, the Tar Heels won their fourth N.C.A.A. Championship.Now, at age 47, I am a New York City dad who watches Carolina basketball obsessively with his three sons and who, after a 15 year hiatus (thanks to a couple of knee surgeries) decided to play pickup again. But on the court recently, I came to a shocking realization.My ugly but effective left-handed heave was no longer effective. I had become the player in the pickup game who everyone leaves open from a distance.Call it ego, but I really didn’t want to be that guy. So I turned to the only expert I knew — my 10-year-old son’s basketball coach.Macky Bergman, 35, runs Steady Buckets, a nonprofit that teaches more than 1,000 boys and girls from around the city. Coach Macky, as everyone calls him, is a product of New York City basketball — he was a star player at Bronx Science and played four years at the University of Rochester. He assured me that anyone could learn to shoot if they put the time in.But could a middle-aged, undersized father of three really remake his jump shot and become a solid pickup basketball player again?Coach Macky and I met in early October on a typical outdoor court — fenced-in blacktop, metal backboards, rims with no nets — on Second Avenue and 19th Street. It was 8 a.m. on a weekday, so the place was vacant, except for a grousing tenant who lived near the court and asked us to practice as far away from his home as possible. This somewhat safe space meant I could relax a little, although the pressure was still on, as both Macky and the Times photographer, sent to track my progress, were both former college players.We began with a shooting test: a series of midrange and 3-point jumpers while moving between five spots on the court. I did this 10 times, shooting 10 free throws after each round. By the end I was drenched in sweat.The results weren’t great — 62 percent from the free-throw line, 49 percent on 2-point jumpers and an abysmal 30 percent from the 3-point line. As for my self-taught shooting technique, which even my son, Kavi, had described as “pretty ugly,” Coach Macky decided we would have to start over from scratch.In our first few sessions, we set about erasing the muscle memory of 1983 to develop proper form. We started as close to the basket as possible — almost directly under the rim.The ball was to be perched just above my eyes, on the fingertips of my left hand, directly underneath the right angle at the bend of my elbow. My guide hand would hold the right side of the ball."
Basketball,"As Nets guard Joe Harris walks the cobblestone streets outside the team’s practice facility in Sunset Park, no one seems to notice.“Most of the time, I blend in,” he said. “I kind of look like I work in a Brooklyn coffee shop.”Harris’s journey from unemployed castoff to indispensable starter mirrors the rise of the Nets, a team reconstructed through savvy draft picks and second-chance signings. Without a marquee star, the Nets have won 19 of their last 25 games, and they are on a six-game winning streak against opponents in the stronger Western Conference.The Nets had 28 victories last season; now, despite a loss in Boston on Monday, they have the sixth-best record in the Eastern Conference (27-24), and playoff talk is brewing. The injury-riddled team has weathered the loss of Caris LeVert, out with a foot injury since November, and now is without Spencer Dinwiddie, a strong candidate for the Sixth Man of the Year Award, who may be out until mid-March with a thumb injury. In Dinwiddie’s absence, the next-man-up Nets will look to G League call-ups and increased scoring from everyone.“I almost look at Joe as one of the poster boys for the Brooklyn Nets,” the veteran DeMarre Carroll said. “He came in, wasn’t really guaranteed his first year, got on the team, worked his butt off. Each year, he’s gotten better; his numbers, his play, his confidence proves it.”Three years ago, Harris, then with the Cleveland Cavaliers, had the worst day of his basketball life. In a period of a few hours, he had foot surgery, was traded to Orlando and was immediately waived. He was out of the league for six months before the Nets signed him to a minimum contract for less than $1 million in 2016. Last summer, he signed a two-year, $16 million deal to remain with the Nets.“His story is about opportunity and development on a team starting to improve,” Coach Kenny Atkinson said. “Given where he came from, it’s a romantic story, a beautiful story. Everything about him — his humility, the fact that he rides the subway everywhere — is why everybody loves Joe.”Harris’s romance with the game began in Chelan, Wash., where his father coached high school basketball. In fourth grade, Harris came home one afternoon and asked his mother if he could write his basketball goals on his bedroom walls. She assumed he would scribble them on paper and tape them up. Instead, he took a marker and wrote directly on the walls and ceiling. The writings remain in his childhood bedroom, frozen in the amber of a 9-year-old’s penmanship.Given that Chelan is a small town with only two gyms, the worst time of the year was when the courts were being refinished, leaving Harris nowhere to play. One time after an interminable wait, a 10-year-old Harris ran onto the court, slid on his stomach and kissed the floor. “Baby, I’m back!” he screamed.“That pretty much sums me up as a kid,” Harris said. “I just love basketball.”To the right of his childhood bed is his favorite quotation from John Wooden, which he easily recites from memory: “Success is a peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing that you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming.”There are also lines from Charles Barkley, Julius Erving, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird and others, as well as a list of goals. The last goal on the list: “Become a pro.”After playing four years at Virginia, Harris was drafted in the second round by Cleveland in 2014. He played sparingly for two seasons on the LeBron James-led Cavaliers. A few months after he was released, he watched Cleveland win its first N.B.A. title.This season, Harris was averaging 13.4 points a game through Sunday and had the third-best 3-point shooting percentage in the N.B.A. (46.8 percent). Among players with at least 300 field-goal attempts this season, he was eighth at 61.4 in effective field-goal percentage, trailing only Golden State’s Stephen Curry (62.1) among guards and wing players, according to Basketball-Reference.com.“We want him to shoot more bad shots because he’s such a great shooter, but he won’t because he’s such a good guy,” Atkinson said."
Basketball,"In his two years as president of basketball operations for the Los Angeles Lakers, Magic Johnson presided over a team as chaotic and playoff-free as the one he’d inherited.The Lakers succeeded in stockpiling talent — including the franchise-altering signing of LeBron James — but failed in putting together complementary pieces, or attracting the second major star Johnson openly said he was chasing.[Magic Johnson stunned the basketball world by suddenly stepping down on Tuesday.]Here’s a look back at Johnson’s high and low points while running the team.In February 2017, four seasons into the team’s longest-ever playoff drought, the Lakers reshuffled their front office by firing the general manager, Mitch Kupchak, and installing Johnson as its president. Less than a month later, Rob Pelinka, a longtime agent, was hired as the general manager, reporting to Johnson.Officially and unofficially, Johnson had remained tied to the team since he retired in 1996. He owned a share of the team from 1994 to 2010, and after that he was an honorary vice president — a title the team took away from him after he violated the league’s tampering rules by tweeting about free agents.Three weeks before he was hired in his new role, he had returned to the Lakers as an adviser to Jeanie Buss, the team’s president and co-owner. She would soon clean house while promoting Johnson.“Everyone associated with the Lakers will now be pulling in the same direction, the direction established by Earvin and myself,” she said, using Johnson’s given name. “We are determined to get back to competing to win N.B.A. championships again.”The first major test of the new regime had decidedly mixed results.Days before the draft, Johnson shed the costly contract of Timofey Mozgov by giving up on D’Angelo Russell, whom the team had selected second over all just two years earlier. In return for the duo, the Brooklyn Nets gave up Brook Lopez and the 27th pick in the draft, which turned into the promising Kyle Kuzma. But Russell has blossomed this year with the Nets, earning an All-Star appearance while leading Brooklyn back to the playoffs.Russell’s departure opened the point guard spot for Lonzo Ball, who has flashed two-way potential but largely fallen short of his lofty expectations as the second pick in the draft. In addition to Kuzma, the Lakers struck gold with Josh Hart, who was selected 30th and has become a core piece.Johnson made no secret of his intent to draw the game’s biggest stars to Los Angeles, with an eye toward what was expected to be a major 2018 off-season. The team largely punted on the 2017 off-season to preserve its salary cap space in 2018, signing Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to a one-year deal.At the 2018 trade deadline, the Lakers shed the contracts of Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr., opening more cap space. Johnson said the trade indicated the Lakers would have the cap space and the ability to land two star players, either by trade or free agency.“I wouldn’t have made the move if I wasn’t confident,” he said at the time.Signing LeBron James to a long-term contract in 2018 was exactly the kind of result the Lakers had planned for and needed, setting expectations that they would return to the playoffs and compete for a championship. But the free agents the Lakers signed to surround him — Caldwell-Pope, Rajon Rondo, Lance Stephenson, JaVale McGee and Michael Beasley — immediately puzzled some observers."
Basketball,"Kyrie Irving scored 37 points and the Boston Celtics rallied late in the fourth quarter to beat the Indiana Pacers by 99-91 on Wednesday night. The win gave Boston a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven, first-round seriesComing out of a timeout and with a chance to tie, the Pacers’ Wesley Matthews threw an inbounds pass into the bench on the other side of the court with 12.1 seconds left. On the ensuing play, the Celtics’ Al Horford passed to Jayson Tatum, who was fouled on a two-handed dunk. He completed the three-point play to make it 97-91 with 8.8 seconds left.The Pacers turned it over again and the Celtics were able to close out the game at the free throw line.Tatum scored 26 points, including a thunderous dunk down the stretch to help punctuate a 10-0 run by Boston over the final five minutes.[Read: Jayson Tatum has a daily reminder of the booming dunk he delivered on LeBron James last year.]Bojan Bogdanovic led Indiana with 23 points. Thaddeus Young added 15 points.Indiana led by 79-68 entering the fourth. Horford opened the final period scoring on a hook shot in the lane and Tyreke Evans responded with a 3-pointer on Indiana’s first possession.But then Boston caught fire, using a 16-0 run, including eight straight by Irving, to take an 86-82 lead with 5:04 to play. Indiana missed 10 straight shots during the run, finally breaking a nearly eight-minute scoring drought with a 3-pointer by Matthews in front of the Celtics’ bench.Horford had been a game-time decision with an illness, but was able to remain in the Celtics’ starting lineup. He was noticeably a step slower at the outset and didn’t take his first shot until late in the second quarter. He didn’t score his first points until the fourth, finishing with four points, 10 rebounds and four assists for the game.Game 3 is Friday in Indiana.BUCKS 120, PISTONS 99 Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 13 of his 26 points in Milwaukee’s big third quarter and the Bucks beat the Detroit Pistons, 120-99, on Wednesday night to take a 2-0 lead in the first-round playoff series.Eric Bledsoe led the Bucks with 27 points, and Khris Middleton had 24. Milwaukee is trying win a playoff series for the first time since 2001.Luke Kennard had 19 points for Detroit. Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond each added 18, and Drummond had 16 rebounds. Detroit star Blake Griffin sat out again with a left knee injury, but received a technical for the second straight game for arguing from the bench.After scoring 10 points and playing only 14 minutes in the first half because of foul trouble, Antetokounmpo scored Milwaukee’s first seven points in the third quarter. The Bucks outscored Detroit 35-17 in the period to take a 93-76 lead into the fourth.Detroit clawed within seven in the fourth before the Bucks put it away, capped by a hard drive by Antetokounmpo on a break. He banked in an awkward reverse-angle shot while crashing to the floor after being fouled by Drummond. He competed the three-point play it make it 105-87."
Basketball,"LeBron James, sidelined since Dec. 25 with a groin strain, will remain out until at least next week, the Los Angeles Lakers announced Wednesday. The team said in a statement that James did not travel with the Lakers on their current road trip for games against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday and the Houston Rockets on Saturday.The Lakers have struggled without James — and without Rajon Rondo, their backup point guard, who was also injured in the Lakers’ road win over the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day. Entering Thursday, the Lakers had gone 4-7 without those two players and were tied with the Sacramento Kings for eighth place in the Western Conference standings.[On Pro Basketball: The Warriors Prepare to Add Another Star: DeMarcus Cousins]After their current trip, the Lakers will return home to play the Warriors on Monday — which, incidentally, is slated to be Game 2 of the Warriors’ well-publicized DeMarcus Cousins experiment as he returns from surgery on his Achilles’ tendon — but it is highly unlikely that James will be available. The Lakers said in their statement that James “has been cleared to return to practice commencing next week, and progress toward a return to game play thereafter.”James, 34, had been fairly indestructible thus far in his career. He appeared in all 82 regular-season games for the Cleveland Cavaliers last season. But while the Lakers initially listed James as “day to day” after he underwent a magnetic resonance imaging exam last month, the team has been handling him — and his eventual return — with caution.James was playing some of the best basketball of his career before he got hurt, averaging 27.3 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists a game. A four-time N.B.A. most valuable player, he is in the first year of a four-year contract worth $154 million."
Basketball,"John MacLeod, the coach who led the Phoenix Suns on an improbable run to the 1976 National Basketball Association finals against the Boston Celtics — a series that included one of the most memorable playoff games in N.B.A. history — died on Sunday. He was 81.MacLeod’s son, Matt, confirmed the death to The Associated Press but did not say where he died. The elder MacLeod had Alzheimer’s disease for more than a decade.MacLeod joined the Suns in 1973 after they had ended a 38-44 season. At the time the Suns, who joined the league in the 1968-69 season, had never won an N.B.A. playoff series.His first two seasons in Phoenix were rocky, but in time he became the most successful coach in Suns history, going 579-543 in the regular seasons over 14 years.MacLeod’s first winning season with the Suns ended with a 42-40 record, just enough to edge them into the 1976 playoffs. Phoenix then went on a dramatic run that culminated in their defeating the top-ranked Golden State Warriors for the Western Conference championship in seven games.The finals against the Celtics featured a tense fifth game, with the teams tied at two games apiece, that went into triple overtime at Boston Garden and into the basketball history books.Coming back from far behind, Phoenix tied the game at the end of regulation play and again at the end of the first overtime. Many fans swarmed the court after the Celtics star John Havlicek sunk a shot at the end of the second overtime to put Boston ahead, 111-110. But the referees ruled that a second remained on the clock and cleared the court.The game, with an unruly capacity crowd in the stands, went into a third overtime because of a canny decision. With that one second remaining, the Suns Hall of Fame guard Paul Westphal called a timeout, even though Phoenix had none left. That cost the Suns a technical foul and gave Boston another point on a successful free throw, but it also gave the Suns the ball at center court for a final play. The Suns forward Gar Heard took the inbounds pass, shot and tied the score, 112-112.“Credit that move to Paul Westphal,” MacLeod told The New York Times. “He thought of it while we were trying to map out a play. But with all those fans surrounding him, taunting our players and causing more fights, how could a coach coach? It was the most dangerous situation I’ve ever been in.”In the end, the Celtics triumphed, 128-126, and won the series, four games to two. The Suns, nicknamed the Sunderella Suns for their unlikely run, went on to appear in eight more playoffs and two more Western Conference finals under MacLeod.He had a franchise-record 37 playoff victories with the Suns and was placed in the Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor in 2012.The Suns dismissed him in 1987, after the team started the season 22-34. He also coached the Dallas Mavericks from 1987 to 1989, taking them to the playoffs in one season, and the Knicks, in 1990-91, achieving a 32-35 record. He finished his 18-year head coaching career with a 707-657 mark.John Matthew MacLeod was born on Oct. 3, 1937, in New Albany, Ind. He played basketball at Providence High School in Clarksville, Ind., and at Bellarmine University in Louisville, Ky.He was a successful head coach at the University of Oklahoma before he joined the Suns. He was later the head coach at the University of Notre Dame from 1991 until 1999. MacLeod’s son Matt played on the team for his last two seasons as coach.After leaving Notre Dame, MacLeod returned to the Suns as an assistant coach. He was also an assistant with the Denver Nuggets and the Warriors, ending his career in 2006."
Basketball,"Paul George has a small freshwater pond behind his house in Oklahoma City that he stocks with bass, crappie and bluegill. Whenever he has a couple of hours to spare from his responsibilities as a do-everything forward for the N.B.A.’s Thunder, he heads out back with his fishing rod. He releases what he catches — for now, anyway.“Waiting for them to get a little bigger,” he said.George has time. Last summer, on the first night of free agency, he agreed to re-sign with the Thunder on a four-year, $137 million deal. The news emanated from a house party that Russell Westbrook, his superstar teammate, was hosting for George, who did not even entertain meetings with rival teams. He was sticking with the Thunder.In doing so, George made clear that he was banking on his partnership with Westbrook while offering endorsements of the organization and of Oklahoma City’s leisurely pace. He can fish. He can raise his two young children in a quiet neighborhood. And he can focus on basketball, knowing that his future is with the Thunder.“You can give your everything to one organization, and you know the direction that you’re going,” George said in a recent interview. “There’s so much that players have to deal with that I don’t think people quite recognize. A lot of them are the same issues that everybody else deals with. But this takes a lot of the burden off my shoulders.”There is something to be said for (relatively) stress-free living. As several other stars careen toward free agency this summer — and grapple with the accompanying distractions with varying degrees of success — George, 28, has been playing the best basketball of his life.He is averaging 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.2 assists, all career highs, while shooting 44 percent from the field and 39.1 percent from 3-point range. He is at least in the conversation for his first N.B.A. Most Valuable Player Award.“I think the shift I’ve seen,” Coach Billy Donovan said, “is a guy who’s a lot more comfortable.”George has been limited recently by shoulder soreness, and Oklahoma City has slipped a bit in the standings. But the Thunder are capable of being a force in the playoffs, and they appear to be a close-knit group. One reason: Oklahoma City is not exactly flush with “extracurriculars,” as George put it, so the players tend to linger at the practice facility. They spend a lot of time together, which has helped build chemistry.“And if one person has to go do something, there’s always someone else who’s like, ‘I’ll tag along with you,’” George said. “That’s kind of been the culture here.”George was traded to the Thunder before the start of last season, after he told the Indiana Pacers that he would not sign a contract extension. Most figured that Oklahoma City would be a pit stop for George, who grew up in Palmdale, Calif., about 50 miles north of Los Angeles. More to the point: He had told the Pacers that he wanted to be shipped to the Lakers.Indiana balked and instead dealt him to Oklahoma City, where George averaged 21.9 points and 5.7 rebounds last season. After Oklahoma City lost in the first round of the playoffs, George was a free agent. He could have gone nearly anywhere, including to the Lakers.“I had so many phone calls and people asking me what he would do when it was all still up in the air,” Tom Hegre, his former coach at Knight High School, said in a telephone interview. “But I personally felt that he would stay with the Thunder. I just didn’t think he would bail on something before he gave it a legitimate chance.”Hegre also said he suspected that Oklahoma City itself had something to do with George’s decision. Even now, after six All-Star appearances, George is a small-town guy and a self-described “homebody.”Back in his high school days, George and his father would occasionally ask Hegre if the team was planning to practice over the weekend. Hegre knew that meant they were thinking about going fishing. They had their favorite spots: Hughes Lake, Lake Elsinore, Lopez Lake, Little Rock Reservoir."
Basketball,"Lou Williams, who has the unusual role of leading the Clippers in scoring while coming off the bench, does not run around the court so much as flutter across it. At 6 feet 1 inch and 175 pounds, he has embraced his identity as a butterfly among a herd of cattle.But at this stage of his career, Williams wants to feel as light and nimble as possible — so he essentially starves himself on game days. After a big breakfast, he refuses to eat again until well after the game itself, often going nearly 12 hours between meals.It is one of several habits that Williams, 32, has developed over the years, and one that clearly works for him. It is also the opposite of how most elite athletes prepare for games. But Williams is different: He wants to take the court with an appetite.“That’s crazy,” Landry Shamet, the first-year Clippers guard, said. “I’d weigh about 115 pounds if I did that.”The Clippers, as they often have this season, turned to Williams on Monday night for an extraordinary performance — this time against the Golden State Warriors in Game 2 of their first-round playoff series. In the Clippers’ 135-131 win, Williams collected 36 points and 11 assists to help erase a 31-point deficit.Shamet sealed the biggest comeback in N.B.A. playoff history with a go-ahead 3-pointer with 16.5 seconds left, and the Clippers evened the best-of-seven series at one game apiece.“I’m one of those guys who can get hot,” said Williams, who shot 13 of 22 from the field, “and I just got lost in the moment.”The Clippers, who have thrived behind Williams in the wake of a midseason deal that sent Tobias Harris to the Philadelphia 76ers, will need all of him again — all his scoring, all his savvy, all his unusual rituals — when the Warriors come to Los Angeles for Game 3 on Thursday.Make no mistake, the Clippers have their share of scrappy, no-nonsense guys. Patrick Beverley, who has spent the series covering the Warriors’ Kevin Durant like aluminum foil, would trash talk a telephone pole.Williams, on the other hand, carries himself with a brand of quiet composure that has a power all its own.“He goes about his business,” said Sam Cassell, an assistant coach for the Clippers. “He’s not overwhelmingly faster than people. He’s not bigger than people. But he understands what he can do on the basketball court, and he does it well.”The Warriors’ Klay Thompson recently came across a package of highlight clips from Williams’s days as a star guard at South Gwinnett High School outside of Atlanta. What stood out to Thompson was how little Williams had changed.“He played the exact same way,” Thompson said in an interview before the start of the series. “It was incredible: same step-back jumper, same hesitations, same floaters.”Williams has stuck with the same general blueprint while refining his skills — slicker, craftier, jazzier. He has also become more resilient. There was a time, he said, when he thought his career might be finished. In 2013, he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee while playing for the Atlanta Hawks. In his comeback, he turned to Kenny Atkinson, who was then one of the team’s assistants, to help reassemble his game.Atkinson, now the head coach of the Nets, imbued Williams with the importance of routine."
Basketball,"The Knicks won a basketball game Thursday night. That has not happened since Jan. 4.There won’t be a ticker-tape parade, but it was a surprise. This, after all, has been a really bad season for the Knicks.They are 11-47. The win, over the Atlanta Hawks, 106-91, broke an 18-game losing streak, which was a franchise record.The team traded away its most popular player by far, Kristaps Porzingis, and in return got a rookie and a couple of expiring contracts. The deal also meant the cancellation of the coming Latvian Heritage Night at Madison Square Garden, which frankly was shaping up to be one of the highlights of the season.To be fair, a core of loyalists insist that these Knicks are a fun bunch to watch. And there is optimistic talk for next year.The Knicks are bad enough to have a decent shot at the top draft pick, probably Zion Williamson, Duke’s superstar big man. Cap space will allow the team to seek big-name free agents, and there is sunny speculation that the team could land stars like Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving or even both.We’ll see about that. But for now, fans are left pondering if the Knicks are historically dreadful or just run-of-the-mill dreadful.Let’s see how the Knicks rate, at least in the current century.That means this year’s Knicks won’t have to compete against the consensus worst team of them all, the legendary 9-73 Philadelphia 76ers of 1972-73.Despite a couple of 50-win seasons, in 2000 and 2013, the Knicks’ winning percentage this century is .416, worst in the N.B.A. Yes, even worse than the Washington Wizards, and Charlotte Hornets, and even the Nets.Here is how the 2018-19 Knicks stack up.This is where it begins and ends. Wins. Losses. But mostly losses. Lots and lots of losses.The Knicks are 11-47, giving them a winning percentage that looks like a typo: .190.But there were worse seasons in the last 20 years. In 2012, the Bobcats (now the Hornets) finished at 7-59 in a lockout season for a .106 percentage.Over a full season, the 76ers in 2016, in full tanking mode, only barely managed to break double digit wins with a 10-72 record."
Basketball,"HOLBROOK, Ariz. — A wind that would not stop tugged at flags and sent sand devils spinning into this desert town as I walked past Mr. Maestas Restaurant and the Arizona Pawnman and the Empty Pockets Saloon and came to a rise and looked across an emptiness of plain that stretched the limits of vision.I recalled my talk a few days ago with Mike Budenholzer at the Ritz-Carlton in New York City. He coaches the Milwaukee Bucks, who finished the regular season with 60 wins and the best record in the N.B.A. His team features a brilliant Greek forward-guard-center named Giannis Antetokounmpo, Montenegrin and Turkish forwards, a Spanish center, and black and white players from corners rural and urban.He is known for his deft handling of diverse pro players. Where, I asked, did you pick up that skill?Let me tell you about my hometown, Holbrook, he said.Budenholzer, blue-eyed and middle-age, was once was a skinny, blond, teenage shooting guard in this old cattle and railway town. He starred on the Roadrunners basketball team at Holbrook High School alongside his boyhood friend B. J. Little, an African-American; a few Anglos; and a half-dozen Navajo boys who could run and pass all day and all night.“There’s no doubt in mind that my background there has helped me navigate life in the N.B.A.” Budenholzer said. “Growing up, you knew Navajo culture and black culture from Louisiana and Mexicans. I learned to foster the same sort of culture.”Holbrook comprises its own world, an isolated high desert city of 5,053 that sits on the southern lip of the Navajo Nation, which is the size of the Republic of Ireland. To the south lies the small Mormon town of Snowflake, and beyond that the forests and canyons of the White Mountain Apache Reservation, which is bigger than Delaware.Holbrook’s population is roughly 50 percent white and 50 percent Navajo, Hopi, Mexican and black. The city has long kept a dormitory for Navajo children whose parents want them to attend the well-regarded Holbrook High School. Founded in the 1880s, Holbrook was an outlaw-friendly habitat, and a sign on the South Side tends to underline this point: Bucket of Blood Street. Terrill’s Cottage Saloon once stood on this street, and more than a few cowpokes breathed their last there.Quite a few youngsters leave in search of better prospects. The city is tattered at the edges, a few buildings lie gape-toothed and abandoned, a motel stands vacant, and a single movie theater shows a single movie. But it’s a hospitable place, and the main drag, Navajo Boulevard, has Mexican restaurants and motels and Native American jewelry stores and a herd of giant plastic dinosaurs that signal proximity to Petrified Forest National Park.Budenholzer’s father, Vince, coached the basketball team and won a state championship in 1971 and was inducted into the state coaching hall of fame. At the time, Mike was an assistant to Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs. During a team visit to Phoenix, he told Popovich of his father’s ascent. When Vince showed up later that day, Popovich got down on a knee in the hotel and said, “Here is a real coach.”Father and son were two hoops tramps who traveled in school buses hundreds of miles across the empty quarter of Northern Arizona in search of games and wins.Vince’s Holbrook teams played a variation on the Native American hoops style known as Rez Ball: A quicksilver, sneaker-squeaking, run-pass-pass-shoot style, perfect for the Navajo and the Apache, for whom distance running is a millenniums-old tradition.“We pressed from the minute we stepped off the bus,” Vince said. ”I had one Navajo who was taller than 6 foot, and so what?”Vince is 89 and still lean in that way of an old athlete, and he and his wife, Libby, moved nine years ago to Queen Valley, in the cactus foothills of the Superstition Mountains, east of Phoenix. They miss Holbrook; it remains the home of their hearts, but the winters on that mile-high plateau ran them off. “The winds never stop blowing,” Libby said.The couple raised seven children, five boys and two girls, in a small house across Florida Street from Hunt Park. Libby became a councilwoman and served a term as mayor, and Vince moonlighted as Holbrook’s parks and recreation director during the summer. He built a hoop in his backyard and put up a floodlight so the teenagers could play into the evening."
Basketball,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Stephen Curry was about 25 minutes into a news conference here on Saturday afternoon when a magician who goes by the name Jibrizy sidled up to the dais to do a card trick. Curry, the Golden State Warriors point guard, seemed impressed.“That was nice, big fella,” Curry said. “That was crazy. Y’all see that? Did y’all see that? What’s your name, boss? Jibrizy? Nice to meet you, man. Fire. You’re fire. That’s what’s up.”Lots of weird stuff tends to happen during N.B.A. All-Star weekend, and a cameo by Jibrizy was no exception. But it was also the rare instance when the spotlight left Curry, if only for a moment, in the run-up to the weekend’s flagship game on Sunday.Curry, a six-time All-Star and two-time most valuable player who has already coaxed Golden State to three championships, is used to lots of attention. But he relished his return to Charlotte, where he grew up to become perhaps the greatest shooter of all time — and where he is still revered.“From the time I started playing basketball at 5, right down the street at the recreation center, to now, a lot has happened,” Curry said. “A lot of great things.”Curry was not so great Sunday, but that was not the point. He finished with 17 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists for Team Giannis in a 178-164 loss to Team LeBron in the All-Star Game, which was a defense-free postscript to a weekend that was a Curry family affair.“Incredibly fond of the family,” Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters. “They seem to be the first family of Charlotte, at least this week.”For much of his trip home, Curry was accompanied by his father, Dell, who spent 10 seasons playing for the Charlotte Hornets, and his mother, Sonya, who drilled a half-court heave after the family helped refurbish a community center. It was probably the family’s splashiest shot of the weekend.“I was surprised,” Stephen Curry said, “because the first four she flung underhand, they didn’t make it to the rim. And then that last one, it just looked good from the moment it left her hand, and I was going, ‘Wham, bam, can of ham! That’s going in!’ ”Curry had less success in Saturday night’s 3-point shootout, where he was joined by his younger brother, Seth, who plays for the Portland Trail Blazers. Stephen Curry made it to the championship round before losing to Joe Harris of the Brooklyn Nets.But Curry had also found time to return to Davidson College, his alma mater, where he clambered into the student section to celebrate an 80-72 victory over St. Joseph’s on Friday night.“The energy in the building was unbelievable,” Curry said. “It’s surreal every time I get to go back there.”The following afternoon, Curry swayed in a sea of reporters (and at least one magician) as he fielded a wide-ranging mix of questions.What did it mean to him to be back in Charlotte? “It’s kind of overwhelming to be honest,” he said. “I’ve got to be like the Energizer bunny.”Could he say something nice to all his fans in the Dominican Republic? “I’ve been there, and I hope to go back,” he said."
Basketball,"Steven Soderbergh’s electrifying new film “High Flying Bird,” which debuted Friday on Netflix, tells the story of a fictional N.B.A. lockout set in the Instagram Age, in which longstanding concerns about money, race and social justice are galvanized by disputes over players’ personal images, and who has the right to control them. (Appropriately, the entire film was shot on an iPhone.)The film’s dense but fast-moving script, written by the playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney (“Moonlight”), is also replete with references to the game’s history — not least to the currents of protest and politics that have coursed through pro basketball since it was segregated. There’s a rich subtext here, much of it only hinted at. Below is a spoiler-filled guide.As in baseball, football and most areas of American life, segregation kept black players out of the white pro basketball leagues, confined to amateur and semipro all-black teams, which formed in schools, churches, community centers and the like. Games were frequently paired with ragtime dances to make for a full evening of entertainment.The best known of these barnstorming teams, often called “Black Fives” by historians, were the New York Renaissance and the Harlem Globetrotters. The Renaissance — or, as they were better known, the Rens — were so impressive that in 1947, Coach Joe Lapchick of the New York Knicks lobbied the Basketball Association of America to admit the team into the young league, a precursor of the National Basketball Association. The owners voted him down. The next year, a competing league, the National Basketball League, brought the team in instead.[Read the Times review of “High Flying Bird” by A.O. Scott.]Indirectly. The Rens and the Globetrotters, in particular, were internationally known for their dazzling play, often besting white teams when matched up for exhibition games. The Rens, for example, beat the all-white Oshkosh All-Stars in the first integrated tournament championship in 1939; the Globetrotters beat the Minnesota Lakers in a celebrated 1948 exhibition game that The Chicago Tribune pinpointed as key to the integration of the game.As Spencer (Bill Duke) explains in “High Flying Bird”: “There’s a reason why the N.B.A. started integrating as the Harlem Globetrotters exhibitions started going international. Control. They wanted the control of a game that we played, and we played better.”Lapchick, however, did not give up. In 1950, the year after the Basketball Association of America absorbed the smaller National Basketball League and became the N.B.A., he signed Nat (Sweetwater) Clifton, who had played for the Rens and the Globetrotters (as well as in baseball’s Negro leagues), to join the Knicks. That same season, West Virginia State’s Earl Lloyd joined the Washington Capitals and Chuck Cooper was drafted out of Duquesne by the Boston Celtics. (Another black player, Hank DeZonie, played five games with the Tri-Cities Blackhawks in December of that season.)Talking to The Times in 2008, Lloyd told stories of being heckled and spat upon by fans, although the abuse he encountered was “no comparison,” he said, to what Jackie Robinson withstood three years earlier in professional baseball.Yes — in fact, there were four. (One lasted only a few hours.) In the first dialogue scene of “High Flying Bird,” the sports agent Ray Burke (André Holland) tells a client, “Last time this happened, folks was broke left and right!” That “last time” was the 2011 lockout, which lasted  five months and resulted in the loss of 16 regular-season games, the entire preseason and an estimated $400 million in revenue for team owners and players.A 10-year deal was announced late that November, which heavily favored owners. It reduced player salaries by nearly $300 million and shifted an estimated $3 billion to the owners over the course of the contract. The truncated 66-game season finally got underway on Christmas Day.Much screen time in “High Flying Bird” is spent contemplating the legality of public appearances and exhibition games by league-signed players during the lockout. The 2011 lockout was threaded with similar concerns. The film’s fictional team owners grouse over the attention attracted by a “lockout street ball event in Las Vegas,” presumably inspired by the “lockout league” in Vegas, which comprised two weeks of pickup games with more than 70 N.B.A. players in September 2011, according to The Las Vegas Sun. (Profits from ticket sales were donated to charity).Dozens of players filled the pay gap by picking up spots on teams in Europe and Japan. As The Times’s Howard Beck noted at the time, however, “a vast majority of them are rookies, middling veterans and fringe players.”As New York magazine and others have noted, the character Myra (Sonja Sohn) strongly resembles Michele Roberts, who became the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association in 2014. The first woman in history to head a major sports union, Roberts made waves from the beginning. A Times profile a few months into her tenure noted that she had already “forcefully questioned the league’s pay model and labeled its entire cadre of owners as replaceable.”Like the character she inspired, Roberts is a tough-as-nails negotiator who is undaunted by working in a male-dominated world. “My past,” she told players while making her case for the job, “is littered with the bones of men who were foolish enough to think I was someone they could sleep on.”"
Basketball,"LeBron James can’t say that he wasn’t warned. Lots of us were crowing in the summer, and pretty loudly so, about what would greet the unquestioned Lord of the Eastern Conference if he dared to defect. Sign with the Los Angeles Lakers if you wish, for the sunnier Hollywood life and all the perks, but brace yourself for the most trying regular season of your career if you decide to go West. That was the gist of the scouting report — which in retrospect could not have been much more prescient. On cue: The most daunting and, yes, disappointing season of James’s career is right here, right now, for the biggest name in basketball.And it appears he will soon have to stomach that it’s going on his ledger in the most permanent ink that he was unable to bring a halt to the longest postseason drought in Lakers history — barring an unforeseen resurrection from a fractured group that sits four and a half games out of a Western Conference playoff berth with 19 games to go.No matter how much culpability you wish to assign James for what is poised to go down as the Lakers’ franchise-record sixth successive trip to the draft lottery, he’s going to have to own this as much as the front-office tandem of Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka as well as the under-fire coach Luke Walton.The LeBron Way, for years and years, has worked something like this: He inevitably gets most of the credit when his team flourishes; his teammates absorb the bulk of the blame when things unravel. But this is different. This would be the jarring sight of James, fresh off his eighth consecutive finals appearance, actually missing out on the N.B.A. postseason for the first time since his second professional season in 2004-5, when he was just 20.Even though he can rightly point to his recent groin strain as the biggest standings-altering disruption these Lakers have endured, James surely understands that his maiden campaign in Los Angeles is bound to be recorded in many precincts as a failure to make the playoffs that belongs to him.The Lakers are 4-7 since James returned from the groin injury that sidelined him longer (17 consecutive games) than any previous injury in his 16-year career. They have followed up an unsightly road loss to Atlanta in their final game before the All-Star break with harder-to-rationalize road losses to New Orleans, Memphis and Phoenix since the break.After Saturday night’s humiliation against a 13-51 Suns team, which dropped the Lakers to 30-33, James’s gang only sports a 1.3-percent chance of reaching the postseason, according to Basketball-Reference.com.They also have the league’s eighth-toughest remaining schedule, according to Tankathon.com. We’ll never know if the Lakers, who had risen to a heady fourth in the West at 20-14 when James sustained the groin injury in a Christmas Day rout of Golden State, could have kept building upon that promising start with a healthy LeBron. But we most certainly do know that James’s mere return to the lineup, at 34, wasn’t enough to rescue a roster that has been assailed since conception for its lack of perimeter shooting and its defensive deficiencies. Nor has he been able to galvanize a locker room that was deeply destabilized by the Lakers’ trade pursuit of the New Orleans superstar Anthony Davis, which became all-consuming in late January, and has never recovered. It obviously doesn’t help that James, after missing two key free throws in the final minute Saturday, is also converting a substandard 66.9 percent of his attempts from the line to give his critics more handy fodder.Leaving his home-state Cleveland Cavaliers for the Lakers last July without the accompaniment of a second superstar meant that James, in a far deeper conference, would have little margin for error just to reach the playoffs. When you combine James’s injury absence with the continuing post-Davis malaise and the team’s declining ball movement since Lonzo Ball (ankle) was sidelined six weeks ago, it adds up rather quickly to a margin that is long gone."
Basketball,"The Knicks will not be going to the N.B.A. playoffs.If this doesn’t feel like hot-off-the-presses news, it shouldn’t. You may have checked the standings earlier in the season and seen that the Knicks were 4-10, or 8-20, or 10-40.With Monday night’s 115-108 loss to the Kings in Sacramento, the Knicks fell to a record of 13-51, the worst in the league. Yes, even worse than the Bulls, the Cavaliers and (shudder) the Suns. The loss also officially eliminated them from a playoff race they were unofficially eliminated from months ago.The loss, to a team that will probably also miss the playoffs, was hardly mitigated by a good scoring effort by the rookie shooting guard Allonzo Trier, who had 29 points.The Knicks are last in the league in shooting percentage and last in assists. So, in short, they can’t pass and they can’t shoot. Basketball Reference reports that they are particularly bad at the easiest type of shot, shooting only .603 from three feet or closer and .348 from three to 10 feet, both worst in the league.The rookie center Mitchell Robinson is fifth in the league in blocks and third in blocks per game. That’s good. But no other Knick is in the top five in anything. That’s not good.When you don’t have a lot of wins, you wind up with some losing streaks. It’s just math. The Knicks came into the new year with an eight-game, a six-game and a couple of five-game skids, as one might expect. More unexpected: In January and February, the Knicks lost 18 in a row.On the plus side, the Knicks have put together two winning streaks. One was two games and the other was three.The Knicks have now missed the playoffs for six straight years, just short of the franchise record. From 1960 to 1966, the Knicks missed the playoffs seven straight times. But those Knicks teams always won at least 21 games in that span. This season, the Knicks are on a pace to win 16 or 17 games, giving them a chance to break the franchise-worst record of 17 in the abysmal 2014-15 season.Knicks fans, desperate for a light at the end of the 82-game tunnel, are already focusing on the coming draft lottery, right Spike Lee? Zion Williamson, Duke’s dominant center, is the big prize. Adding Williamson and a couple of free agents lured by the bright lights of New York may finally bring the postseason back to Madison Square Garden.Unfortunately for the Knicks, the rules have been changed some this year, and having the very worst record does not offer any advantage. The three worst teams, one of whom is virtually certain to be the Knicks, all will have an identical 14 percent chance of landing the top pick. If the Knicks really are tanking to get a lower lottery spot, they can probably stop now."
Basketball,"GREENSBORO, N.C. — As advanced statistical analysis and its attendant new technology continue to reshape how sports are understood, watched and even played — when to punt on fourth down in football, where to position a baseball team’s infielders and how to build a winning basketball team — these new numbers also create a vexing problem:How to account for what complex algorithms cannot explain.The thirst for information is such that one essential set of college basketball data that will help determine the field for this month’s N.C.A.A. tournament, Ken Pomeroy’s eponymous KenPom ratings, includes a metric to shed light on when things do not actually go by the numbers.Pomeroy has a rather analog term for it: luck.“Luck is basically performance in close games,” Pomeroy said. “People generally don’t like the term ‘luck’ — that’s the feedback I get. Technically, I’d call it ‘randomness’ or something a lot more wordy, but that doesn’t fit well above a column.”In short, KenPom’s luck factor considers the difference between a team’s record and what the data would expect it to be. If a team’s record is better than its predictive numbers, it is lucky. If it is worse, then it is unlucky.This season, according to the KenPom ratings, no team among the 353 Division I college men’s basketball programs has been luckier than the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.The Spartans resemble a team one might expect from a coach, Wes Miller, who transferred to North Carolina as a walk-on, then earned a letter on a national championship team and eventually a spot in the starting lineup. They are resourceful and determined, and have the ethos (and the recruiting budget) of an underdog.Greensboro has a 28-6 record — the best in program history — and finished second in the Southern Conference, behind Wofford, which was ranked 20th in this week’s Associated Press poll.Did luck have something to do with it?Miller, pulling up a folding chair before a recent practice, reacted as one might expect. He praised Pomeroy as “a genius,” expressed fascination with analytics and said there were others on his staff who delve deeper into the data to provide the most salient information about the Spartans and their opponents.Then he assumed a defensive stance.“I’m not a mathematician,” he said. “I’m a basketball coach who’s always trying to figure out an edge to help me coach better. But there’s never been anybody that could put a number on will and togetherness of group.“There’s something that’s happening in our games that’s indescribable to his data that’s getting us over the hump,” Miller added. “That’s toughness. That’s the ability to win close games. The proudest I ever am as a coach is when we have an awful shooting game or we have an awful offensive game and things don’t go our way and we still find a way because our team was able to dig down and figure out a way to get over the hump.”Francis Alonso, a senior guard from Malaga, Spain, who is the heartbeat of his team, put it another way: “There’s this saying — it’s champions’ luck.”"
Basketball,"Zion Williamson’s legend grows with every game these days, with each new thundering dunk and every stunning new feat of elevation. It has been this way for several years now, with Williamson the featured actor in a growing collection of viral clips that show a player with the skills to outrun almost anyone, to catch almost anything, to challenge almost anybody. Even his lowest moments — the sneaker that couldn’t hold him, the injured knee that cost him five games — have somehow morphed into highlights. But Williamson, an 18-year-old Duke freshman, has been making memorable moments for years. A group of New York Times reporters tracked down some of the people who were present for a few of them, to ask them about the memories that stand out the most.Forgive Tom Konchalski.The publisher of High School Basketball Illustrated first observed Zion Williamson in person at the Elite 24, an all-star showcase for the nation’s top prep prospects, on Aug. 20, 2016. The court at Pier 2 in Brooklyn Bridge Park was the stage, and Williamson was 10 for 10 from the field, scored 23 points and shared most valuable player honors. Konchalski was impressed.To Konchalski’s well-trained eye — in five decades he had amassed an inventory of reports that stretched from Michael Jordan to LeBron James — Williamson, who had just turned 16, appeared to be an interior technician, a player at ease turning on his defender to make it to the rim for understated finishes. Because of Williamson’s body type, Konchalski considered him a left-handed Jamal Mashburn, a reference to the beefy Bronx product who played 11 seasons in the N.B.A.When Konchalski sat down at his typewriter after the Elite 24 to describe Williamson’s effort, he wrote that the “6-foot-5 junior Zion Williamson, the master of quiet domination, provided a bit of fresh air.”Looking back, Konchalski says now, he got it all wrong.“I’m wiping off copious amounts of egg from my face,” he said. Williamson, he knows, “is anything but quiet.” The first time LeBron James showed up to watch Zion Williamson, they wouldn’t let him in the door.It was July 2017, and James, once a transcendent teenage talent himself, went to see Williamson, the next big thing, at a showcase in Las Vegas. Williamson’s team, South Carolina Supreme, was playing Big Baller Brand, which featured LaMelo Ball, a brother of Lakers guard Lonzo Ball. It was, by summer youth basketball standards, a must-see event.James, of course, wasn’t the only one interested in that confluence of basketball stardust. The N.B.A. players Damian Lillard, Andrew Wiggins, Jamal Murray and Thon Maker were in the gym by the time James arrived, adding buzz to a crowd of more than 4,000 that threatened to swamp a court configured to hold less than half that many.Even in warm-ups, the excitement was palpable. The fans oohed and aahed as Williamson tossed balls high in the air and dunked them; many spectators held cellphones, the better to share video clips of a scene that was quickly called the “craziest A.A.U. game ever.” But James never saw any of it. With fans standing a dozen deep, nearly spilling onto the court from every direction, he and his group were told that just letting him into the gym constituted a security risk. A teenager’s mere presence, it seemed, had squeezed out basketball’s biggest star. James was told he couldn’t come in.“We shut him down,” an Adidas marketing executive told CBS Sports at the time. “The corners were 500 deep. That’s where it got insane.” It would be a year and a half before James got to see Williamson play in person. In February, he took a 35-minute flight from Philadelphia to Charlottesville, Va., and watched from courtside as Williamson, playing for Duke, went for 18 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in a win against Virginia. Williamson’s athleticism, James declared, was “ridiculous.” Bishop Richardson was averaging about three alley-oop assists to Williamson every game when their team, Spartanburg (S.C.) Day School, arrived at Ben Lippen School in Columbia, S.C., for a game during Williamson’s junior year. "
Basketball,"LOS ANGELES — Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, was asked about the concept of inevitability before his team faced the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday night, which is something that happens during the N.B.A. playoffs. Some questions are more philosophical than others.In this case, the question had to do with the perception shared by many that the Warriors are invincible, that another championship is theirs to lose: What is it like for Kerr to live inside that bubble, knowing full well that his players are capable of making mistakes and even (gasp) failing?Kerr took the opportunity to recall a moment from his childhood in Southern California. When he was 9 years old, he watched his beloved U.C.L.A. Bruins defeat the Kentucky Wildcats for another N.C.A.A. championship, their 10th in 12 years. Coach John Wooden retired after the game. In the nearly half-century since, U.C.L.A. has won one championship — in 1995, when Bob Myers, now the general manager of the Warriors, was a reserve forward.Kerr made sure to note that coincidence. But his larger point was about how sports are unpredictable, which is one of the reasons they are so appealing. Just as no one knew, for example, that the Warriors would make the wrong kind of history by blowing a 31-point lead on Monday, no one knew that they would bounce back on Thursday by obliterating the Clippers, 132-105, in Game 3 of their first-round series.At the same time, no one knows whether the Warriors will go on to win a third straight championship — or how long this team will remain intact. Nothing is inevitable. Everything is uncertain. All dynasties end.“So you don’t worry about expectations,” Kerr said. “Just go out there and play and do your best and see if you can sustain it for a long time. But everything comes to an end, and we’re just trying to keep this going for as long as we can.”The central (if unmentioned) figure in all of this, of course, is Kevin Durant, who has taken on all comers this season in the form of a 7-foot, long-limbed question mark. Bound for free agency this summer, Durant could stay with the Warriors, with whom he has already won two championships — but most expect him to go. Who knows? The agita has sometimes clouded his team’s season.The only sure thing is his basketball genius, which still belongs to the Warriors — for now if not forever — and was on display Thursday night against the Clippers, as he helped lift Golden State to a two-games-to-one lead in the series. Game 4 is Sunday at Staples Center.“Honestly,” Clippers Coach Doc Rivers said, “they dissected us.”It was a resounding statement by the Warriors in the wake of Monday’s fiasco, and no player was more electric or dynamic than Durant, who made all five of his shots in the first quarter — and somehow seemed to improve as the night went on. He finished with 38 points and 7 assists, shooting 14 of 23 from the field.“He came out super aggressive, in kill mode,” the Warriors’ Draymond Green said. “That was all the difference for us.”Durant’s explosion in Game 3 followed a couple of muted efforts for him early in the series. Defended by the Clippers’ Patrick Beverley, a 6-foot-1 guard whom Durant has described in recent days as both a “pit bull” and a “pest,” Durant managed 23 points before he was ejected in Game 1, then struggled even more in Game 2: 21 points and 9 turnovers while shooting just 5 of 8 from the field.At practice this week, Durant had a scrum with the news media that felt more like a doctoral defense. He explained his approach on offense. He talked about strategy and chemistry and shot selection and rhythm. He may have mentioned the officiating once or twice. He also offered a reminder in case anyone had forgotten.“I’m Kevin Durant,” he said. “You know who I am.”After Thursday’s game, Durant said the only difference was that the team had run more plays for him while putting him in better positions to score, often on the low block. Consider: He scored 27 points in the first half but did not make a single 3-pointer. His mentality, he said, never changes. He was not going to force bad shots. He was not going to turn his matchup with Beverley into some sort of me-first duel."
Basketball,"There is a good chance that LeBron James might not be playing basketball in June of 2020, barring a big free agent signing or a trade. But someone will be onstage discussing him.“King James,” a play by Rajiv Joseph, will be making its world premiere at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago in May 2020, the Steppenwolf announced on Thursday as part of its 2019- 2020 lineup announcement, a diverse slate with a particular emphasis on people of color. Anna D. Shapiro will direct.The show will depict life in Cleveland after 2016, when the Cavaliers won the championship, as two friends “spar in a verbal game of one-on-one, revealing past secrets, present truths, and a possible future after ‘The King’ has left the building.” (Last summer, Mr. James left Cleveland for the Los Angeles Lakers.) The play will also be produced on the West Coast in Los Angeles, where Mr. James currently resides, as part of the Center Theatre Group’s 2020- 2021 season.Other highlights from Steppenwolf’s upcoming season include the debut of “Lindiwe,” a musical featuring works by the famed South African group Ladysmith Black Mambazo (Nov. 7-Dec. 29, 2019). Tracy Letts, a Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize winner, will bring his play “Bug” to Chicago, which is slated to be directed by David Cromer (“The Band’s Visit”) and star Carrie Coon (“Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”, HBO’s “The Leftovers”) and Namir Smallwood (Jan. 23-March 8, 2020).Lauren Yee’s “The Great Leap,” which last year was at the Atlantic Theater Company’s Stage II in New York, will make a leap of its own to Chicago. Another play about basketball, the work tracks an American team’s trek to Beijing in the late-1980s (Sept. 5-Oct. 20, 2019).“The Brothers Size,” an early work of Tarell Alvin McCraney, is headlining Steppenwolf’s young adult programming (Oct. 2–19, 2019), as is the world premiere of “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,” an adaptation of the book by Erika L. Sánchez, which will be directed by Sandra Marquez (Feb. 26-March 21, 2020)."
Basketball,"BOSTON — Jayson Tatum boomed on LeBron James in last year’s N.B.A. playoffs. You may remember it. Tatum, the 21-year-old swingman for the Boston Celtics, certainly does.The dunk drew a “wow” from the play-by-play broadcaster Mike Breen. A reporter wrote on Twitter that in the locker room afterward, he overheard James saying that Tatum had “boomed” him, before James repeated four times, “He’s so good.”“I’ve got a big-ass picture of it in my house,” Tatum said in a post-practice interview on Tuesday.The dunk came in the fourth quarter of Game 7 of last year’s Eastern Conference finals. Starting from outside the 3-point line, Tatum took two dribbles with his left hand to get to the rim before hammering a right-handed dunk past James, who attempted a block as a helpless defender. Tatum followed the booming with a chest bump of James, one of his boyhood idols, as if to say, “I’m here.”The Celtics lost that game, but the dunk solidified Tatum, who played one season at Duke, as an emerging N.B.A. star.After the Celtics’ disappointing regular-season run this season, Tatum’s star hasn’t been as bright so far in these playoffs as Boston faces the Indiana Pacers in the first round. He did not make the leap many had thought he would: While he improved as a rebounder and passer, his shot selection led to more long 2-pointers, causing his true shooting percentage to dip from .586 in his rookie campaign to .547 this year, placing him below .560, the league average.He increased his frequency of midrange jumpers but decreased his accuracy in making them: 37 percent, down from 44 percent. Many of his advanced metric statistics, including win shares per 48 minutes, value over replacement player and box plus/minus, were worse this year.Tatum finds himself in an unusual spot, compared with fellow N.B.A. sophomores like Utah’s Donovan Mitchell and Philadelphia’s Ben Simmons. The better Tatum plays, especially in this postseason, the more likely he is to be linked to trade rumors, particularly those involving Anthony Davis, the New Orleans Pelicans star who has requested a trade that could shift the competitive balance in the N.B.A.Several college starters in this year’s Final Four were older than Tatum. But if he cannot live up to the hype he created in last year’s playoffs — that is, if he becomes just another guard — the Pelicans may be more likely to accept a package from the Los Angeles Lakers or another team besides Boston. At the same time, if Celtics point guard Kyrie Irving opts for free agency this summer, the future of the franchise may rest on Tatum’s shoulders. At barely 21, he’d be the alpha.Tatum’s future is more uncertain than many other players who have received significant early acclaim. But one way or another, the Celtics need Tatum to be great. Not just for this year’s playoffs, but for the future.In short, they need him to boom.In a conversation at the Celtics’ practice facility about his future and the atypical stakes, Tatum had talking points at the ready, ones that he had delivered multiple times before. He stared straight ahead, not making eye contact, as if he were running through the script in his head.“Trade rumors don’t bother me,” he said in his deep monotone. “They’re talking about trading me for guys like Anthony Davis. So, I mean, I must be doing something pretty well.” When pressed on whether this bothered him, he didn’t budge: “I love the game of basketball. Being traded is part of the game. I’ll play for whomever. It’s something I can’t control.”He didn’t have much more to say than that. But that is Tatum’s personality, Brad Stevens, the Celtics’ head coach, said. No distractions. That, Stevens said, is his best quality.“Circumstances don’t affect him,” Stevens said. “First game of the season, he’s unaffected by the jitters that everybody has. Seventh game of a playoff series? Unaffected. At least, he shows himself to be unaffected, and he can thrive in that environment.”"
Basketball,"ATLANTA — Kyle Kuzma had his first interaction with LeBron James a little more than a year ago, when Kuzma was a first-year forward with the Los Angeles Lakers and James was a few months from dragging the Cleveland Cavaliers to another appearance in the N.B.A. finals. Kuzma had reached out by phone, hoping for some tips.“Just wanted to see how one of the greats takes care of his body and has so much longevity,” Kuzma recalled this week in an interview. “Everybody wants to play basketball for as long as possible.”So much has changed since that initial conversation. Kuzma and James are teammates now, and Kuzma is experiencing the unique challenges that come with playing alongside one of the game’s behemoths. At the same time, James’s body finally betrayed him this season, which has only heightened the sense of urgency within the organization: The Lakers, who have missed the playoffs for five years running, are not in position for a patient rebuild.James, at 34, may still be in his prime, but the stakes are already high for a franchise that desperately wants to maximize his time in Los Angeles. And while neither James nor Lakers management has shown much enthusiasm for coaxing along a young core — the Lakers tried to ship half the roster to New Orleans last week — they are stuck in this together. James was supposed to be the savior of a flagship franchise gone astray; salvaging the final months of this year would be a key indicator that he still wields that type of power.“We have to approach the rest of the season just like you would during the playoffs,” Kuzma said.As Kuzma recalled his talk with James, he had no way of knowing that the Lakers were mere hours from suffering one final implosion before the N.B.A. All-Star break — a 117-113 loss to the Atlanta Hawks that left the team with a losing record and ample opportunity for soul searching.“It’s time for us to get away and reflect a little bit about where we are as a group,” Coach Luke Walton said. “I think this first part of the season, we’ve gone through a lot of adversity. And we’re probably not where we want to be, but we’re still close enough.”Close enough, that is, for vying for a spot in the playoffs, which was both an indication of the team’s modest goals and its sad reality. At 28-29, the Lakers are in 10th place in the Western Conference standings. It is unfamiliar territory for James, who has not been on a losing team this late in a season since he was a first-year forward with the Cavaliers.“But with LeBron on your team, anything is possible,” said Mychal Thompson, a power forward for the Showtime-era Lakers and an analyst for the team’s radio broadcasts. “I mean, look at some of the teams he’s taken to the finals — including last season. He’s capable of doing great things if you just get on board and run with him.”The Lakers, though, seem fragile after nearly five months of drama — all of it stemming directly or indirectly from the $154 million deal that James signed to join the team last summer. The pressure was on from the start, and little has gone according to plan.“There’s been more noise this year,” Walton said, “but that was to be expected with the moves in the off-season. That was something to be anticipated.”Where to begin? Brandon Ingram and Rajon Rondo were suspended for trying to brawl with the Houston Rockets two games into the season. Magic Johnson, the team’s outspoken president of basketball operations, chastised Walton in a closed-door meeting for the team’s slow start, igniting lasting questions about Walton’s job security. Nearly every player on the roster has been injured, and that includes James, who missed 17 games with a strained groin.And lest we forget: Last week, Johnson and General Manager Rob Pelinka tried to trade away nearly half the roster to the New Orleans Pelicans for Anthony Davis, who, before the start of the season, hired the same agent who represents James. It was the clearest sign yet that Johnson is willing to attempt the very boldest moves — no matter the residual damage.Consider that the Lakers, amid their ultimately fruitless effort to pry Davis away from the Pelicans, lost by 42 points to the Indiana Pacers. And with rumors of which Lakers would be traded swirling through social media, it was difficult to find arguments in their defense — even from James himself.Kuzma, who was offered up as one of the pieces in a potential deal, said it had been difficult to drown out the noise."
Basketball,"LOS ANGELES — To celebrate their first home win in 25 days, the Lakers on Sunday dropped streamers that had been collecting dust from the ceiling at Staples Center. The final lineup of the night included Alex Caruso, a 25-year-old guard who spent most of the season in the N.B.A.’s developmental G League.Caruso knows things were not supposed to be this way. His mere presence — in a crunchtime situation, no less — was a vivid sign that the season had gone sideways for the Lakers, who will be watching the playoffs from various vacation destinations.Caruso also knows that the Lakers are playing fairly meaningless games, including Sunday’s 111-106 victory over the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers (32-41) have nine more of these to go, starting Tuesday against the Washington Wizards. The buzz of LeBron James’s first season as a Laker is gone. The roster will be overhauled again this summer as the franchise, which has not been to the playoffs since 2013, rummages for solutions.“But for me,” Caruso said, “these games are really meaningful.”The Lakers are searching for motivation wherever they can find it, especially as they head toward an off-season of uncertainty. Coach Luke Walton’s job status is tenuous at best, and 10 players on the current roster do not have guaranteed deals for next season. Some of them, like Caruso, are trying to showcase their skills in hopes of acquiring N.B.A. work next season.“I think this little stretch has been really good,” Caruso said, “because it’s finally allowed me to put all that work I’ve put in over the last two years and show how much I’ve evolved as a player. That I’m gaining confidence and making strides to get better and better.” In 16 appearances for the Lakers this season, Caruso has shot 44.6 percent from the field, averaging 6 points and 2.2 rebounds.Even players who figure to be a part of the franchise’s future are focusing on personal growth. A team is always a collection of individuals, but the Lakers’ late-season emphasis on “me” is particularly understandable.“I need to use these games to develop myself and play with the ball more,” the second-year forward Kyle Kuzma said recently.The Lakers were not yet mathematically eliminated from playoff contention when they lost to the Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 17 — that would happen five days later — but Kuzma stood by his locker in a red leather jumpsuit after the game and spoke about the immediate future.“I’m just trying to use these last 13, 14 games — whatever we have — to just try to develop good habits,” he said. “Season’s pretty much over, so that’s the only thing I can really do. Everyone knows I’m a good scorer and I can do that. I’m just trying to complete my game.”Then there are the injured players who have largely disappeared from view: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart. For them, the end of this season is about rehabbing for the next one.After all the losses, injuries and general dysfunction, Walton continues to preach the importance of team play. Same as ever.“It starts with our effort and how we play and how we compete,” he said. “And our guys have been doing a nice job of that, even though we haven’t been winning games. Whatever lineups we’ve been putting out there, they’re giving what they have. So that’s the No. 1 thing.”As for James, these are his first truly inconsequential games since his rookie season with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who finished well out of playoff contention. But even then, he could use the end of the season as an opportunity to hone his abilities and gain experience for future endeavors — such as eight consecutive trips to the N.B.A. Finals.So it is a credit to James, even as the grease fire of his first season with the Lakers smolders, that he is out there — trying. Against the Kings, he finished with his 81st career triple-double: 29 points, 11 assists, 11 rebounds. How does he sustain the motivation?"
Basketball,"The N.C.A.A. said on Saturday that it was appealing a Federal District Court’s decision this month that barring athletes from being paid beyond a scholarship and related costs violated antitrust law.“We believe, and the Supreme Court has recognized, that N.C.A.A. member schools and conferences are best positioned to strengthen and revise their rules to better support student-athletes, rather than forcing these issues into continuous litigation,” Donald Remy, the N.C.A.A.’s chief legal officer, said in a statement.Remy said the decision to appeal, by the N.C.A.A. and the major college conferences named as defendants in the suit, was unanimous.The ruling this month by Judge Claudia Wilken in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California was actually far more favorable to the N.C.A.A. than the plaintiffs, a class of Division I men’s and women’s basketball players and football players, had hoped.The suit, known as Alston after a lead plaintiff, argued that the N.C.A.A.’s rules barring payments to players — the center of what the association terms the collegiate model, and what is broadly known as amateurism — was illegal collusion. It asked the court to declare as much, and to eliminate all such rules, leaving it up to individual conferences to set caps independently if they so chose.Instead, while Judge Wilken agreed that the rules were illegal, she found that an alternative, in which the N.C.A.A. continued to restrict payments unless they were tied to education, was acceptable. Under her ruling, colleges could give athletes items like computers, but the N.C.A.A. could continue to bar them from receiving cash in express exchange for their athletic contributions.Judge Wilken cited a 2015 ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in a similar case, in which a three-judge panel partially insisted that payment to athletes be “tethered to education.” The same appellate court — albeit probably three different judges — would hear this appeal.While the N.C.A.A. largely welcomed Judge Wilken’s finding when it was handed down, it said on Saturday that it sought more: to get the courts out of regulating college athletics as much as possible.“While the district court upheld the distinction between full-time students who play college sports and professional athletes, it erred by giving itself authority to micromanage decisions about education-related support,” Remy said.Jeffrey Kessler, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said of the appeal in a text message on Saturday morning: “We are not surprised. It was a major defeat for the N.C.A.A.”"
Basketball,"Sports curses come in all shapes and sizes. They can involve livestock, soup commercials, magazine covers and, frequently, the selling of star players.In recent years, the rapper Lil B has made a name for himself in the sports realm with his curses — most notably on James Harden of the Houston Rockets — but it appears he has some new competition: the rapper Ja Rule.It all started on Saturday, when Ja Rule was performing at halftime of a game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the host Milwaukee Bucks.The performance came on the 17th anniversary of Ja Rule’s collaboration with Ashanti, “Always Be On Time,” hitting No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100. But the show came under criticism immediately because of a somewhat misleading video of the crowd reaction and another one showing an unexpected guest: Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks’ star forward, who came out to begin warming up for the second half while Ja Rule was still performing on the court along with a group of dancers.The rapper initially shrugged off the criticism, but his tone changed when the Timberwolves decided to mock the performance on social media. In a post to Twitter, the team said “We too were hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hood winked, lead astray!!!” The post was a reference to an earlier post by Ja Rule about his role in the ill-fated Fyre Festival, a luxury music event in the Bahamas that failed spectacularly in 2017. The rapper was not amused.The potential effects of this particular curse are unclear, though. The Timberwolves have existed as a franchise for 30 seasons and not only have not won a championship, but they have only made it out of the first round of the playoffs once — in 2004. They are 28-31, putting them just outside legitimate playoff contention, and the notion that Karl-Anthony Towns is departing anytime soon — as Ja Rule suggested with “AND KAT IS LEAVING!!!” — seems unlikely, as he has signed a five-year contract extension that kicks in next year and guarantees him nearly $160 million.Of course, logic does not have to play a role in sports curses. The Chicago Cubs endured the so-called Curse of the Billy Goat for more than 70 years after the team asked the owner of the Billy Goat Tavern, William Sianis, to leave a game because his goat was bothering fans. That the team had not won a World Series in more than 30 years before the episode was treated as mostly irrelevant. Other popular curses have included one in which the athletes endorsing Campbell’s Chunky Soup seemed to become injured at an extraordinary rate. Another claimed that athletes had their performance fall off after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated.The most famous, of course, is the Curse of the Bambino, which doomed the Boston Red Sox to lose after selling Babe Ruth to the Yankees in December 1919. The jinx is credited by some with keeping the Red Sox from winning a World Series for 86 years, despite the first year of that stretch coming before the team sold Ruth, and the fact that the curse was barely mentioned in popular culture before George Vecsey wrote a column about it for The New York Times in 1986. Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe also wrote a book in 1990 that popularized the phrase.At the very least, the talk of Ja Rule’s curse was good news for Lil B, who spent part of the weekend trending on Twitter. He celebrated by retweeting various people saying Ja Rule was simply stealing a tactic that Lil B had already perfected."
Basketball,"The Philadelphia 76er who made the greatest impact in Game 3 of the team’s first-round playoff series against the Nets wasn’t Ben Simmons, the N.B.A.’s reigning rookie of the year, who scored 31 points. Nor was it the team’s most dominant player, Joel Embiid, who missed the game with knee tendinitis. Or the sharpshooter J.J. Redick. Or the four-time All Star Jimmy Butler.It was Tobias Harris, the oft-traded, oft-underappreciated power forward who has an ego compact enough to fit inside his white headband — with room to spare.“Tobias was our bell-ringer tonight,” 76ers Coach Brett Brown said Thursday after the 131-115 win gave Philadelphia a two-games-to-one lead in the best-of-seven series, which resumes Saturday in Brooklyn.Harris finished with playoff career highs of 29 points and 16 rebounds and made all six of his 3-pointers. At 6-foot-9, he owned the perimeter against the Nets’ smaller guards, and his work on defense was just as effective.“You start looking at Tobias’s rebounds and what he did from the 3-point line,” Brown said. “I’m proud of him. He’s good people, and he was fantastic tonight.”The Nets are the feel-good story of the postseason, given the expectations for them last fall. But after losses in the last two games, it would seem that chemistry, scrappiness and heart go only so far against a Philadelphia lineup with the most talent outside Golden State.Harris, who is from Dix Hills on Long Island, was the final piece of a Sixers team assembled to make a deep playoff run. In early February, amid the best season of his career, Harris was traded from the Los Angeles Clippers. He could have signed an $80 million contract extension with the Clippers in the last off-season but decided to gamble on himself instead. He elected to play out his final year and become an unrestricted free agent this summer in hopes of a max contract — and some stability.Having been traded five times in eight seasons, Harris would like to be able to drop off his dry cleaning, then wake up in the same city to pick it up. At 26, after an All-Star-caliber season, he is looking for a home. That might even be Philadelphia.He averaged 20 points and 7.9 rebounds this season in a total of 82 games with the Clippers and Sixers. In 27 regular-season games for Philadelphia, Harris averaged 18.2 points, tying him with Butler for second on the 76ers’ scoring list, behind Embiid, who averaged 27.5.For Game 4, the 76ers may still be without Embiid, which means that they will again need balanced scoring from the rest of their talented cast. On Thursday, Philadelphia had three scorers with 26 or more points (Simmons, Harris, Redick). The last time the franchise accomplished that in a playoff game was Game 3 of the 1978 conference semifinals against the Knicks. That night, it was Julius Erving, George McGinnis and World B. Free.“I felt good,” Harris said. “I just came in knowing with Joel down, it was a big scoring loss we had out there. I had to be aggressive from the start. I got some good looks throughout the game. I was able to let it fly, and it felt good for it to go in.”“It was a big game personally for myself and for the team, too,” he added.Beyond basketball, Harris co-stars in the best buddy movie in the N.B.A., known as the Bobi + Tobi Show. In 2016, Harris and Boban Marjanovic, a 7-foot-3 Serbian center, developed a close bond while playing for the Detroit Pistons. They were then traded to the Clippers for Blake Griffin in January 2018. About a year later, they became a package deal headed to Philadelphia.The Clippers produced three web episodes of the “Bobi + Tobi Show” focused on the pair’s friendship and foibles. They took a SoulCycle class together. They attempted a dance lesson. The fun continued in Philadelphia, where a TV station did a quiz show segment with them, focusing on trivia about their new city. Neither could pronounce “Schuylkill.”In Game 3, Marjanovic played the sidekick during Harris’s star turn. He came off the bench and split time with Greg Monroe, who had replaced Embiid in the starting lineup."
Basketball,"It was a humble TV listing, informing readers that the Knicks would be playing the Washington Bullets on MSG that night. The short item noted that “The Knicks tried double-teaming Jeff Ruland in the second of those games, but the tactic didn’t work: He responded with a triple double-digit effort — 22 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.”It was Dec. 29, 1984. And for the very first time, The New York Times had cited the triple-double.On Monday night, Russell Westbrook completed an unprecedented 10th consecutive triple-double, with 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists as the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Portland Trail Blazers. Westbrook broke the record of nine, set by Wilt Chamberlain in 1968.But while triple-doubles are no longer uncommon — Westbrook’s teammate Paul George turned in an even more immpressive line (47 points, 10 rebounds, 12 assists) on Monday — the term is relatively new. Like Chamberlain, some of the greatest practitioners made every one of their triple-doubles when triple-doubles were not even a thing.The Times quickly embraced the triple-double. Two days after its debut, the label made it into an ordinary sports article, this time without the clunky words “digit” or “effort.” Precedent had been set.In those early days, some of the references to triple-double in The Times were in quotes, as if editors were afraid that the new term would pollute the newspaper’s august pages. Eventually the arbiters of style settled on no quotes, and a hyphen in between the two words.The first triple-double in Basketball-Reference’s database is from 1950, when Andy Phillip of the Philadelphia Warriors tallied 17 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, although there were almost certainly others before that when stat keeping was less precise and complete.Harvey Pollack, the longtime 76ers stats guru, is generally credited with inventing the term in the early 1980s, inspired by Magic Johnson, who made a habit of triple-doubling. (Ruland, though he was the Times’s triple-double pioneer, claimed only five in his career.)There are also double-doubles — the career record is held by Chamberlain — and quadruple doubles, for those who can also manage 10 blocks or steals. That has only happened a handful of times in the N.B.A., and not since David Robinson in 1994.There are even quintuple doubles, a stupefying exploit — 25 points, 18 rebounds, 11 assists, 10 steals and 10 blocks — performed by the women’s star Tamika Catchings when she was in high school in 1997.Westbrook has taken the triple-double to new heights, though, actually averaging a triple-double for the last two seasons. He is on pace to do so again this season. And unlike his early predecessors, he is keenly aware of the stat, often looking to add that one more assist or rebound that he needs late in a game.Westbrook now has 127 total triple-doubles, closing in on Johnson, the inspiration for the term, who has 138.But above all of them is Oscar Robertson, the only other man to average a triple-double; he had 181 in his Hall of Fame career.His last one came in 1974, when the feat was still unnamed, at least in The Times."
Basketball,"LOS ANGELES — At the midpoint of the N.B.A. season, Kyle Kuzma was daydreaming about something the Lakers have yet to unveil: a small-ball lineup with LeBron James manning the center position. The Lakers already generate the third-highest pace in the league using a traditional lineup, so imagine the possibilities.“That small-ball lineup is going to be huge for us,” Kuzma told reporters on Wednesday morning, “especially in the playoffs when everybody’s going to be going small.”Kuzma, a second-year forward, was making two assumptions: first, that the Lakers would make the playoffs, and second, that they would have enough time to experiment with the lineup and refine it ahead of a hypothetical trip to the postseason. Not to stamp all over Kuzma’s enthusiasm, but neither of those is a guarantee given the way the Lakers’ hodgepodge season has gone.Coach Luke Walton, to his credit, is taking a more pragmatic approach. Though he entered the season hoping to unleash a smaller lineup that could cause mismatch problems, the Lakers do not have time to mess around with experiments, he said, not right now, not after their recent struggles, not with their continuing rash of injuries and absences.“It’s going to get tougher to do,” Walton said, adding: “As the season gets further and further down the road, those, ‘Hey, let’s try this during the game’ — it’s going to be less and less because we’re in a pretty nasty fight for who gets in and who’s not in. So it will be more about what we’re good at, and try to get better and better at that.”Every team copes with injuries of varying magnitudes, and the Lakers have dealt with their share. On Wednesday night, LeBron James — no longer indestructible, apparently — missed his eighth consecutive game with a strained left groin, but he looked upbeat on the home bench at Staples Center during his team’s 113-100 victory against the Detroit Pistons.“I thought our team showed a lot of growth from, however you want to call it, the post-LeBron injury,” said Walton, whose team improved to 23-19.An important caveat: The Pistons, who have lost 15 of their last 19 games, are not playing stellar basketball. But the LeBron-free Lakers are beginning to look more cohesive and more confident than they did in the days after they lost him to his injury on Dec. 25. They have won two straight, with James’s return date still uncertain.After the Lakers’ medical staff evaluated James on Thursday, the team announced in a statement that he was progressing and had been cleared “to increase on-court functional basketball movements.” He is scheduled to be re-evaluated next Wednesday, but in the meantime the Lakers will play on without him, starting Friday against the Utah Jazz.James’s absence — however long it lasts — may not wind up being the worst thing for the Lakers. His workload over the past decade-plus has been immense, with most of his seasons extending through the N.B.A. finals. He just turned 34. Assuming he returns at full strength, without complications, James could probably benefit from a midseason break.More important, perhaps, has been the opportunity for the team’s lesser lights to operate on their own. The training wheels are off. For a while, it looked bleak. The Lakers lost five of their first six games without James, and it got bad enough that Kobe Bryant logged on to Twitter to defend Walton from an angry mob.“Relax,” Bryant, one the franchise’s most iconic figures, wrote in a post on his account. “Entire squad is damn near out.”At the time, the Lakers were without James, Kuzma and Rajon Rondo. Rondo could miss another two to three weeks after undergoing surgery on his right hand (for the second time this season), but Kuzma, who was sidelined for two games with a back contusion, has since returned.On Monday, with the rust from his injury still apparent, Kuzma shot 4 of 20 from the field in a win against the Dallas Mavericks. On Tuesday, an off day for the Lakers, he went to the practice facility and took 500 shots, Walton said. On Wednesday, Kuzma scored a career-high 41 points in 29 minutes while shooting 16 of 24 from the field.“If you would have told me two years ago, when I was in college, that I would score 40 for the Lakers, I probably wouldn’t have believed you,” Kuzma said. “Kind of crazy.”"
Basketball,"DENVER — Moments after the Golden State Warriors finished obliterating the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday night, Draymond Green was asked about a teammate who did not even play — a teammate, in fact, who has yet to log a single minute this season but is nearing his much-anticipated debut.“Hopefully,” Green said, “it’s devastating for everybody else.”Let that soak in for a second. The Warriors, who have won three of the last four N.B.A. championships, are already good at basketball. All they did on Tuesday was set an N.B.A. record by scoring 51 points in the first quarter — the first quarter! — against a team that came into the game with the best record in the Western Conference.But now, after signing DeMarcus Cousins over the summer and spending recent months incorporating him into their dynastic fold as he recovered from Achilles’ tendon surgery, the Warriors expect him to be in their starting lineup when they visit the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night. It is a grand experiment that will play out over the second half of the season.“More than anything, we’re just excited for DeMarcus,” Coach Steve Kerr said late Tuesday night, adding: “It’s going to take him some time to get his rhythm.”Cousins, a 28-year-old center and a four-time All-Star, has not played since Jan. 26, 2018, when he tore his left Achilles’ in a game for the New Orleans Pelicans. At the time, Cousins was having a career season, with averages of 25.2 points, 12.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists a game. He was also due for free agency and an enormous payday.But his type of injury has ended careers, particularly among big men, and every team in the league balked at offering him a long-term deal. He wound up with the Warriors, who signed him to a one-year contract worth $5.3 million — a modest price for a reclamation project with upside and little obvious risk.“It’s a relief,” Cousins told reporters last week. “It’s been a long year for me, a lot of ups and downs, but the finish line is ahead.”There is no way of knowing if Cousins, who is listed at 6-feet-11 and 270 pounds, will ever be the top-tier player he once was. But the Warriors neither need nor expect him to be a focal point of their offense, and if he merely commands attention from defenders, especially in the post, he should free up additional space on the perimeter for the team’s cavalcade of shooters.“We haven’t had a player like him before, so it will be new,” Kerr said. “It won’t be a simple ‘plug him in and he’ll fit right in.’ We’ll play through him some, so there will be a period where we have to adapt. Fortunately, we’re halfway through the year. We have a lot of games to figure this out.”Since the Warriors began collecting championships under Kerr in 2015, they have had a rotating cast of dependable but unspectacular centers: Andrew Bogut, Festus Ezeli, Zaza Pachulia, JaVale McGee. Cousins has never been a role player, though he acknowledged his new (and unfamiliar) place in the Warriors’ ecosystem.“Well,” he said, “I won’t be taking as many shots as I have in the past.”He also has a reputation for being emotional, and something of an antagonist. Some of the Warriors have firsthand experience. Kerr recalled getting ejected after arguing with the officials in a game against the Sacramento Kings in 2017, back when Cousins was playing for them. But before he left the court, Kerr caught Cousins taunting him by waving goodbye.Then there was an episode last season, when Cousins was playing for the Pelicans, and he got into an altercation with Kevin Durant. After both players were ejected, Cousins tried to track down Durant outside the Warriors’ locker room — and not to exchange pleasantries.“It shows that you care,” Cousins said of playing with passion. “It shows that it means something to you. I’m not really fans of the guys who are emotionless on the floor.”"
Basketball,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — After two weeks of Anthony Davis’s trade request dominating conversation around the N.B.A., Commissioner Adam Silver on Saturday sounded sanguine about any possible negative effects it was having on the league.“Some of the greatest players in the history of this league have demanded trades at various points of their contracts,” he said at his annual All-Star weekend address. He went on to say that there was “very little” he could do to completely stop players from trying to force trades.Davis was fined $50,000 for the public trade request made by his agent, Rich Paul. Silver said it was healthy for players and their agents to have ongoing conversations with their teams about future intentions, but that he preferred that such conversations happen behind closed doors. As for the frenzy of news media attention surrounding Davis and his possible destination this summer, Silver said the “public spectacle” wasn’t the type of media interest the league wanted.“We certainly are becoming a 52-week-a-year sport, and it’s largely the result of tremendous interest in these players,” he said. “I think we could do a better job as a league in avoiding those situations where they get to the point where players are maybe demanding they be traded or, worst-case scenario, saying, ‘I’m not going to honor my contract.’”[Slam Dunk Contest: Hamidou Diallo’s Dunk Is Even Better Viewed Frame by Frame]Silver has frequently stated a desire to improve the N.B.A.’s competitive balance. Asked whether small-market teams could compete with large-market franchises, Silver largely disputed the premise without even citing the fact that the Milwaukee Bucks, a small-market club, currently have the best winning percentage in the league.He took the opposite approach.“I’m not even sure where the line is anymore on big markets,” he said, pointing out that the Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks and Chicago Bulls — teams that play in major cities — have struggled on the court in recent years.Silver also said it was too early to judge whether reforms to the draft lottery, intended to reduce the incentive to tank in pursuit of a high draft pick, were having the intended effect. Four teams this year are on pace to win fewer than 20 games, but Silver said there is also an unusually large number still in contention for a playoff berth.“I personally don’t think it is a winning strategy over the long term, losing for multiple years,” said Silver. He also said that choosing to be uncompetitive for an extended period of time would most likely have a “corrosive’’ effect on any team that took that approach.Taken together, Silver’s responses to questions suggested that he was relatively happy with the state of the N.B.A. and believed that the league’s problems could be solved through tweaks to the system, not wholesale changes.Silver opened the news conference by addressing House Bill 2, the law passed in North Carolina in 2016 that invalidated local government ordinances establishing anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and required people in publicly owned buildings to use restrooms that corresponded with the genders listed on their birth certificates. In response to the law, the N.B.A. took the All-Star Game, originally scheduled to be played in Charlotte in 2017, away from the city.He said it was the view of the league office that the law discriminated against the LGBTQ community, and subsequently the N.B.A. made the decision that it was “inconsistent with the values of this league to play the All-Star Game here under those circumstances.” The N.B.A. decided to return after the law was partially repealed.Asked about efforts to improve the culture of the Dallas Mavericks, where a league investigation found numerous instances of sexual harassment and improper conduct among employees, Silver offered few specifics but said there was a “complete sea change in culture on the business side” of the organization.Earlier Saturday, the N.B.A., in partnership with the International Basketball Federation, announced the formation of the Basketball Africa League, a 12-team professional league made up of clubs from across Africa. The league will begin play in 2020, the first time that the N.B.A. will be involved in the operation of a league outside of North America."
Basketball,"[Want to read more from Marc Stein? Sign up for his free weekly newsletter here.]Andrew Bogut made his return to the N.B.A. on Wednesday, signing a rest-of-the-season contract to rejoin the Golden State Warriors. The reunion came two years to the day since Bogut, the former No. 1 overall selection in the 2005 draft, sustained a gruesome leg injury.Bogut, 34, spent this season starring for the Sydney Kings in his native Australia and, by his own admission, was convinced “that the N.B.A. door had shut.”But the Warriors began lobbying Bogut to rejoin them in December and made it to March with a roster opening for the 7-foot center, who wasn’t available to be signed until the Kings’ season ended last weekend.“I was kind of blown away,” Bogut said in a telephone interview from Australia. “This wasn’t a situation where I threw my hat in the ring to try to get signed in the N.B.A. I wouldn’t do that.“To come back to the N.B.A., for me, was basically Golden State or nothing. But the fact it was Golden State — it was the kind of opportunity that I would be kicking myself if I didn’t take.”When Bogut signed a two-year deal with Sydney last April, he described it as “my official retirement from the N.B.A.” He proceeded to win Most Valuable Player and Defensive Player of the Year honors in Australia’s National Basketball League, averaging 11.4 points, 11.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.7 blocks per game.Bogut’s contract with Sydney does not contain an N.B.A. release clause, but he told the Warriors that he would entertain the prospect of rejoining them on a short-term basis after the Australian season — as long as Sydney officials blessed it — should Golden State still have a need.Had the Warriors succeeded in landing a recent free agent from the so-called “buyout” market — such as the swingman Wesley Matthews, who opted to sign with Indiana after securing his release from the Knicks — they would have had no roster room for Bogut.But once it became clear that the Chicago Bulls would refuse to release the veteran center Robin Lopez before March 1, thus missing deadline for Lopez to retain his playoff eligibility with a new team, Golden State intensified its pursuit of Bogut as soon as the Kings were eliminated from the N.B.L. playoffs.As the Warriors continue to try to assimilate the former All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins into their rotation, Bogut said he had “no illusions” about the fact that “some games I’ll play and some games I won’t.” But Bogut insisted he was “happy to be a positive influence on that bench” no matter how much he plays.The Warriors assistant general manager Larry Harris, who was Milwaukee’s general manager in 2005 when the Bucks selected Bogut with the top pick in the draft, made a recent scouting trip to Australia to assess the state of Bogut’s game firsthand and convey the seriousness of Golden State’s interest.Warriors Coach Steve Kerr referred to Bogut as “an insurance policy in the frontcourt.” But Bogut’s defensive know-how and his familiarity with the Warriors’ star trio of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green certainly can’t hurt the league’s prohibitive championship favorites in the quest to improve on their woeful standing of 16th in defensive efficiency (109.5 points allowed per 100 possessions.)“I didn’t foresee this happening but I’m excited as hell about it,” Green told Bay Area reporters. He and Bogut quickly meshed as co-anchors of a vaunted Golden State defense in 2014-15, when the Warriors began their five-season run of dominance.After the Warriors won a league-record 73 games in 2015-16 but blew a 3-1 lead to the LeBron James-led Cavaliers in the N.B.A. finals, Bogut and the veteran forward Harrison Barnes were quickly jettisoned to Dallas to create the requisite salary-cap space for Golden State to sign Kevin Durant."
Basketball,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.The N.B.A. playoffs begin this weekend, which for those who report regularly on the world’s premier professional basketball league means one thing: the temporary suspension of life as they know it.If it’s April, it’s time to tie up loose ends at home, kiss the significant other or beloved cat goodbye and wish the kids well on the soccer pitch. Someone please remember to send Mother’s Day flowers. Father’s Day will be celebrated pending the length of the finals.The reporting grind of the 82-game regular season is disruptively hectic enough. But during the postseason, the sport sheds its least watchable teams, as well as a few that are competitively marginal, and gets down to the games that conclusively matter.Breakout performances will become instant classics. Acknowledged stars could transition into legends with championship rings. Nothing may be missed in the postseason business of media-driven mythmaking.Will Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors win a fourth ring in June, bringing him within two of Michael Jordan’s and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s half-dozen each (though still far behind Bill Russell’s 11)? Or will destiny call upon a first-timer like the so-called Greek Freak, Giannis Antetokounmpo of the rising Milwaukee Bucks?As a sports reporter and columnist for four decades, the last 25 years of which were with The Times, the playoffs habitually meant two months of missing the springtime sun and — by the early 1990s — my two young sons, while chasing the extended N.B.A. family of one-name luminaries. (You know who I mean: Magic, Larry, Michael, LeBron.)Throughout the playoffs, reporters must confront the crush of late-night deadlines while nattily dressed superstars complicate filing by taking their sweet time getting to the interview podium. Hours later, it’s on to the next city, the next round, often dealing with the logistical conundrum of never being sure when one series will end and the next will begin.For a portion of my years on the basketball beat, that meant attaching myself to the Knicks, who children of a certain age might have a hard time believing consistently qualified for the playoffs. That was way back in the 1990s, otherwise known around New York as the Patrick Ewing Era.When Ewing’s Knicks were ousted, it was on to chronicle Michael Jordan and his Chicago Bulls as they accumulated six titles in eight years, disbanding in 1998 and ceding short-term control of the sport to the Los Angeles Lakers of Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant. And so it went, into a new century that spawned even greater global exposure and scrutiny of a virtual one-man industry, LeBron James Inc.For those having slept through the last six months, James will not be appearing in the 2019 playoffs after a gargantuan run of reaching the league championship series for eight straight years. His migration to Hollywood from Cleveland produced a critically assailed version of Lakers Showtime that, had he not signed a four-year contract last summer, would have already been canceled. (The Lakers’ hope of attracting a worthy co-star is as yet unrealized.)Hence, the fortunes of the soon-to-be free agents Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and others will be fascinating spring subplots. No reporters worth their credentials will risk blinking through a telltale expression or a body-language betrayal of otherwise guarded intentions.The playoffs, while typically impassioned and illuminating, are also logistically exhausting, but I confidently speak for my N.B.A. media brethren when I say that covering them is far more privilege than punishment.The game looks much different now — so much of it focused on 3-point shooting — than it did during my earliest years on the N.B.A. beat. Back then, I routinely insisted there was no place in the world I would rather be than the old, ventilation-challenged Boston Garden for a showdown between the Celtics and Lakers. The modern and far more international N.B.A. media no doubt is equally passionate.But lives do change. Issues arise. We in the ever-more-distant press-row seats do not attend games with traditional partisan interests, but over the long playoff haul, personal circumstances and needs do create some dilemmas."
Basketball,"With all of the trade drama surrounding Anthony Davis and Kristaps Porzingis, the N.B.A. intruded on the N.F.L.’s run-up to the Super Bowl as we have not seen since Kobe Bryant scored 81 points on football’s so-called Championship Sunday in 2006.Now that the Super Bowl is over and even more of North America’s sporting consciousness is there to be seized by professional basketball’s tireless headline-makers, here is our best advice: Buckle up.What follows is a by-the-numbers look at what the N.B.A.’s 73rd season has served up so far — and what the next five months hold.Through Sunday’s games, only the Milwaukee Bucks were on a 60-win pace. The Bucks’ Eastern Conference-leading record of 38-13 projects to a 61-win campaign — which could keep this season from being the league’s first since 2000-1 without a 60-win club.There are realistically 11 teams battling for the Western Conference’s eight playoff spots, after the new calendar year began with 14 teams in the conference — all but Phoenix — in the race. Dallas, New Orleans and Memphis have dropped off in January, prompting all three teams to focus more on trades than the standings.The consensus top three in the Most Valuable Player Award race coming out of Super Bowl weekend are Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo, Houston’s James Harden and Denver’s Nikola Jokic. According to the Basketball-Reference.com M.V.P. Award Tracker, Antetokounmpo awoke Sunday with a 37.8 percent chance of winning — far ahead of Harden’s 21.1 percent.Harden has scored at least 30 points in 26 consecutive games, good for the third-longest such streak in N.B.A. annals behind Wilt Chamberlain’s streaks of 65 and 31.The league’s trade deadline (Thursday at 3 p.m. Eastern) is three days away. This is the second season since 1978-79 (as far back as reliable N.B.A. record-keeping goes) that the deadline falls before the All-Star Game.The New Orleans Pelicans have made two trips to the playoffs — winning only one series — in Davis’s first six seasons with the team. Davis requested a trade on Jan. 28.It took 54 days for the Minnesota Timberwolves to find a trade they liked for Jimmy Butler after Butler’s request to be dealt became public Sept. 18. Butler was snubbed by East coaches in All-Star voting, but the potential ceiling for Philadelphia’s rugged new star threesome was evident Thursday night at Golden State, when Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Butler and Company brought a halt to the longest winning streak of the season — after the Warriors had won 11 in a row.Minnesota is 21-18 since the trade that sent Butler and Justin Patton to Philadelphia on Nov. 12 — and 6-6 since firing Tom Thibodeau, the coach/team president who made it, on Jan. 6. Ryan Saunders, Thibodeau’s 32-year-old replacement, has many admirers around the league, but the Wolves are a long way from convincing skeptics that the deal (to bring in Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick) was sufficient for a player of Butler’s caliber.Thibodeau is one of three coaches to be fired this season — after nine coaching changes in the off-season. The other coaches to lose their jobs since opening night: Cleveland’s Tyronn Lue and Chicago’s Fred Hoiberg.There were 20 teams, entering Sunday’s play, attempting at least 30 3-pointers a game. This is poised to become the first season in N.B.A. history that the leaguewide average per game (31.4) will finish in the 30s.With coaches calling for more 3-pointers than ever before and greenlighting shots earlier and earlier in the 24-second shot clock — along with a new rule that resets the shot clock at 14 seconds on offensive rebounds — teams are averaging 100.0 possessions per 48 minutes leaguewide. The last N.B.A. season in which that figure finished in triple digits was 1988-89 (100.6).Milwaukee’s Khris Middleton, Orlando’s Nikola Vucevic, Philadelphia’s Simmons and Denver’s Jokic will make their All-Star Game debuts Feb. 17 in Charlotte, N.C. The All-Star player draft, in which the captains LeBron James and Antetokounmpo will fill out 13-man rosters by picking players playground-style, is Thursday at 7 p.m. — just four hours after the trade deadline passes. (D’Angelo Russell of the Nets, who was named later as a replacement for Indiana’s Victor Oladipo, who is injured, will also be making his All-Star debut this year.)"
Basketball,"DALLAS — Dirk Nowitzki has seen many things in his 21 seasons with the Dallas Mavericks. What he had never seen, until last month, was a fellow Maverick who could attract nearly two dozen autograph seekers in subzero temperatures to greet the team bus on a Thursday morning in Detroit.Luka Doncic did just that in the 2 a.m. hour of Jan. 31, as the Mavericks pulled into a hotel adjacent to the world headquarters of General Motors, on the unglamorous end of a back-to-back set that began in New York.It is likewise safe to presume that none of Nowitzki’s other 197 teammates over two decades in Dallas could have inspired what happened mere hours later. In a swift-moving blockbuster trade, Dallas acquired Kristaps Porzingis from the Knicks to serve as Doncic’s sidekick, with Mavericks General Manager Donnie Nelson openly admitting that he pushed for the deal because Doncic has “fast-forwarded a lot of our decision-making.”These are the tales from just one day, albeit maybe the wildest day, of what Nowitzki frequently refers to as Lukamania.“When we get to cities now, even late at night, there are so many people waiting with things for him to sign that it’s almost like we’re the Warriors,” Nowitzki said. “Lukamania is real. We’re living it every day.”[Another Rookie: The Perimeter Can’t Protect You From Mitchell Robinson]This week brings another milestone for Doncic, who celebrates his 20th birthday on Thursday. He is averaging 20.9 points, 7.2 rebounds and 5.7 assists through 56 games and is responsible for four of the five triple-doubles in N.B.A. history recorded by teenagers. It is a start that has quickly validated Nelson’s long-held belief that Doncic possessed superstar potential.The only other rookie in league history to hit those levels over a full season was Oscar Robertson in 1960-61.“I love, love, love guys that can pass the ball,” Nelson said, prioritizing Doncic’s ability to run a team at 6 feet 7 inches over the fact he is already known for having the league’s second-most-feared step-back jump shot, behind only James Harden’s.“I knew I could play over here,” Doncic said, “but it’s better than I expected, for sure.”The gaudy numbers and worldwide interest in his exploits enabled Doncic to amass more than four million votes in N.B.A. All-Star balloting, trailing only LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Doncic, in other words, finished higher in leaguewide balloting than Michael Jordan (fifth) did as a rookie. Higher, too, than James (13th) and even Yao Ming, who could manage only the fourth-highest total in 2003 despite the considerable voting might of Yao’s native China.Doncic’s instant production has also validated every pundit who insisted, amid no shortage of skepticism, that concerns about Doncic’s athleticism and corresponding ability to deal with the length of N.B.A. defenders were folly given the rampant success he achieved both at the club (Real Madrid) and national team (Slovenia) levels as an 18-year-old. In the process, Doncic has unleashed a torrent of second-guessing upon the teams (Phoenix, Sacramento and Atlanta) that let him slip to the Mavericks. Yet Doncic insists his maiden N.B.A. season, which appears destined to be christened with the league’s rookie of the year trophy, has not been as easy it looks.The Mavericks, you see, were 26-34 entering Wednesday night’s home date with Indiana and likely to miss the playoffs for a third consecutive season. They have traded away all four of Doncic’s projected fellow starters (Dennis Smith Jr., DeAndre Jordan, Wes Matthews and Harrison Barnes) in deals that netted Porzingis and roughly $30 million in salary-cap space, neither of which can help the team this season.It is the first time in Doncic’s life, since he took up basketball at age 7, that he has experienced losing. One hint of how well he’s coping with it: Doncic has pulled his jersey apart in frustration after a play gone awry — twice."
Basketball,"In a rookie season that has resembled a seismograph, Knicks forward Kevin Knox needed a performance like Sunday’s against the Los Angeles Lakers. He scored 19 points with an array of shots, slashing to the basket, hitting a step-back 3-pointer while guarded by LeBron James and finishing with finesse on a driving, left-handed layup.“Hello, Kevin Knox. It was good to see him play well,” Knicks Coach David Fizdale said. “He’s had his bumps. We know it’s there, it’s in there. It’s just a matter of the ball going in and him getting his confidence up. But I really thought he came with a mind-set that he was going to get out of this rut. The way he was attacking, the force he was playing with.”Knox shot 8 of 14 from the field and 3 of 5 from 3-point range in the Knicks’ 124-123 victory over the Lakers, their 14th win in a dismal season.“I’d been struggling a little bit, but the whole team and coaching staff had confidence in me,” Knox said. “I came to work every single day, got up extra shots. I knew I was going to come out of the streak, so I just wanted to make sure I kept shooting.”Last year the Knicks selected Knox, a freshman from Kentucky, in the first round of the draft, ninth over all. After an ankle sprain sidelined him at the start of the season, Knox’s play took off in December, when he averaged 17.1 points and was named the Eastern Conference rookie of the month.Knox, 19, hit the rookie wall beginning in mid-January, with a 20-game stretch in which he shot 31.8 percent from the field and 27.7 from beyond the 3-point arc. The slump started soon after he scored 31 points, his highest total in the N.B.A., during a game against the Philadelphia 76ers.Shortly before that, Knox had said that he was still learning how to adjust to the demands of the long N.B.A. schedule and its 48-minute games, compared with a 40 minutes in college and A.A.U. ball.“It’s totally different,” he said in late December. “Eight minutes doesn’t seem like a lot, but it really is. That’s a whole quarter almost. Eight minutes is a long time in basketball.”To improve his fitness, Knox did extra sprints after practice and spent more time on the treadmill, running spurts of 15 minutes with the last two as fast as he could.At various points in the season, Fizdale has brought in former Knicks greats like Bernard King, Patrick Ewing, Bill Bradley and Walt Frazier to speak to his young, struggling team. (The coach, who was a Miami Heat assistant coach when James played for them, also made a point of introducing Knox to the Lakers star after Sunday’s game.)King, who was with the Knicks for five seasons in the mid-1980s, and was known for his seemingly unstoppable baseline turnaround jump shot, has focused especially on mentoring Knox.In between their meetings early in the season, Knox studied online video highlights from King’s career.“He helps my game, every time I talk to him,” Knox said. “He’s kind of like me, a wing that gets to the basket, loves transition. He kind of reminds me of myself.”Perhaps the other way around, rook.Knox said he had sought out his own tutors as well, connecting with Chris Bosh, Grant Hill, Jalen Rose, Carmelo Anthony and former Kentucky players for bits of advice during the trying moments."
Basketball,"LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Lakers described last weekend’s N.B.A. All-Star break as an opportunity for a much-needed reset, with the hope that they could ultimately make a playoff push after spending a few days apart. None of it sounded very convincing.But when the team reconvened for practice on Wednesday morning, LeBron James said his level of intensity had been “activated,” as if he were a superhero who had flipped a switch. He does not usually activate himself this early in the season, he said, but the Lakers need all of him now — in large part because they had lost so much ground when he was sidelined for about a month with a groin injury.“We would have loved to have had success when I was out, but we didn’t, so this is where we are right now,” James said.And when asked how he would elevate the play of his younger teammates, he put it simply: “We don’t have a choice.”In other words, it was sink or swim for the Lakers before their game against the Houston Rockets on Thursday night, and there would be no lifeguard.For one night, at least, the Lakers swam. They were cohesive enough to come away with a 111-106 victory against one of the better teams in the Western Conference. For one night, at least, the Lakers showed that they could erase a 19-point deficit by playing solid defense and making their free throws. For one night, at least, the Lakers could depend on players like Brandon Ingram (27 points, 13 rebounds) and Kyle Kuzma (18 points) to deliver in a game that the team really needed to win.The question now is whether the Lakers, who at 29-29 are the very definition of average, can build off it. Consistency has not been their hallmark.“It can give us some momentum that we need,” Coach Luke Walton said, “or it can do nothing. It depends how we respond to this.”Not so long ago, the Lakers had a similarly galvanizing win — or so it seemed.It was Feb. 7, and before the league’s trade deadline Magic Johnson, the team’s president of basketball operations, had failed in his quest to ship nearly half of the roster to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for the All-Star center Anthony Davis. It was a huge soap opera, and the Lakers responded in surprising fashion: by going out that night and defeating the Boston Celtics — on the road, no less.The win, though, was fool’s gold. The Lakers got pulverized by the Philadelphia 76ers three days later, then hobbled into the All-Star break with a loss to the Atlanta Hawks — a performance so devoid of energy that it seemed to signal a dysfunctional locker room, and maybe even one that was beyond repair.The team was below .500.Walton encouraged his players to reflect and refocus over the break. For James, that meant returning to Los Angeles in playoff mode — much earlier than he would prefer.But this is unfamiliar territory for James, a three-time champion who has made 13 straight trips to the playoffs and eight straight appearances in the N.B.A. finals. Now, with an inexperienced batch of teammates on the Lakers, he is merely fighting to lead them into the postseason.“I’m all about being uncomfortable,” he said this week. “I love being uncomfortable. I fall in love with being uncomfortable, so this is another uncomfortable thing for me, and I love it.”"
Basketball,"LOS ANGELES — Rajon Rondo has had a difficult time for the Lakers. He was suspended after brawling with the Houston Rockets in the second game of the season. He proceeded to mangle his right hand not just once, but twice, requiring surgery both times while missing a total of 31 games. And in recent weeks, he has been coming off the bench for Coach Luke Walton, even as Lonzo Ball, who had been starting at point guard, continues to recover from an ankle injury.Rondo, a 13-year pro, was supposed to be an invaluable presence for the Lakers, who had otherwise surrounded LeBron James in Year 1 of the West Coast LeBron era with a cast of unproven (if promising) players and a hodgepodge of reclamation projects. Nobody thought this team would vie for a championship, but the road has been rougher than expected.In the wake of a recent two-game road trip to New Orleans and Memphis that resulted in two deflating losses and the very real sense that the Lakers could miss the playoffs, Walton approached Rondo for a quiet conversation. Walton wanted to put him back in the starting lineup for Wednesday’s game against the Pelicans, and Rondo was on board with the plan.After all, what did the Lakers have to lose? Aside from losing another game that they desperately needed to win.“We sat there and talked,” Walton said. “He’s been fine with his role. He wants to play more — everyone wants to play more. But he hasn’t been complaining or anything like that. But our conversation was one of: ‘Let’s talk about what we need to do. How do we get back on track?’ It was an honest conversation. It was healthy and positive.”As far as confidence-building exercises go, the Lakers’ subsequent 125-119 victory over the Pelicans was not necessarily Grade A material. The Pelicans have their own issues, and their star center Anthony Davis, who had hoped to be playing for the Lakers after this month’s trade deadline, was on a strict minutes limit as the Pelicans eye a summer sweepstakes for his services. (They would like to keep his limbs intact in the meantime.)But Walton’s favorite verb after the game was “need,” as in the Lakers needed the win and needed some positive vibes.Sure enough, Rondo helped a great deal, finishing with 16 assists, 11 points and 7 rebounds in 37 minutes.“I’m very confident in what Rondo has done in this league,” Walton said. “He’s struggled a little bit, but some of that’s on me. His minutes have been down. We’ve been trying to find different groups to work. But he’s proven over his career that when he gets an opportunity, he shows up to play.”Rondo was not particularly adept from the perimeter, shooting 5 of 15 from the field, and Davis feasted on the Lakers’ smaller lineup when he was on the court. Walton knows those could be more pressing issues against better teams. But for one night, the Lakers (30-31) allowed themselves to savor some hard-earned momentum — because it might not last.The Lakers, who have been hindered this season by injuries and trade-deadline intrigue, are not a great basketball team. The question is whether they are merely mediocre, with a chance of still making the playoffs, or not very good at all, in which case they will have wasted their first year with James on the roster.It hardly helps that the Lakers have one of the league’s most difficult schedules the rest of the way, starting Friday when they host the Milwaukee Bucks, who improved to 47-14 on Wednesday with a win against the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers’ coming schedule also includes meetings with playoff-bound teams like the Denver Nuggets and the Toronto Raptors.“Every day is going to be its own challenge,” James said, adding: “Just try to stay positive throughout whatever’s going on.”Rondo had experienced his own set of challenges ahead of Wednesday’s game. He was coming off a pair of dreadful performances during the team’s recent two-game trip, averaging 4.5 points and 2 assists off the bench while shooting 36.4 percent from the field. He was a nonfactor, or perhaps even a net negative.“I didn’t have the rhythm on both ends of the floor,” Rondo said. “That’s why we have 82 games. You have the opportunity to play again and redeem yourself.”"
Basketball,"LOS ANGELES — LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers has shown throughout his 16-year N.B.A. career that he is good at a lot of basketball-related activities, including scoring, passing, rebounding and winning. But perhaps one of his most remarkable assets — a feat, really — is his durability. He seldom misses games because of injury.But now, less than a week after turning 34, James is still on the mend from straining his left groin in a win over the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day. The timetable for his return remains uncertain.The Lakers announced on Friday, before playing the visiting Knicks, that James would not make a coming trip with the team for back-to-back games against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday and the Dallas Mavericks on Monday. The Lakers’ next game after that is on Wednesday against the Detroit Pistons at Staples Center.The team said in its statement that James was making “progress with his recovery” as he received daily treatment from the team’s medical staff and that he would be re-evaluated in one week.Entering Friday, the Lakers had lost three of the four games they had played without James, dropping them to eighth place in the Western Conference standings with a 21-17 record — a precarious position for a team with playoff hopes. The Sacramento Kings were two games back in ninth place.James’s absence has been compounded by the loss of Rajon Rondo, a veteran point guard who injured a ligament in his right ring finger against the Warriors and could miss three to four more weeks after undergoing surgery. Rondo had already missed 17 games this season because of a fractured bone in the same hand.Their absences have meant an increased reliance on the team’s young core, which includes Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma and Lonzo Ball. Those players have delivered at times, but not consistently enough to manufacture many wins.As for James, he had been playing some of the finest basketball of his career, averaging 27.3 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists while shooting 51.8 percent from the field and 35.6 percent from 3-point range. He appeared in each of the Lakers’ first 34 games and had not missed a game since April 12, 2017, back when he was employed by the Cleveland Cavaliers. That gave him a streak of 156 consecutive games played, including in the postseason.“I take a lot of pride in it,” James said of his sturdiness after injuring his groin. “That’s why it pissed me off not to be able to go back into the game. It’s more than anything being available to my teammates, being available to my coaching staff. That’s something I take more personal than anything. Hopefully it’s not a long thing.”The Lakers initially listed James as day-to-day after he underwent a magnetic resonance imaging exam. But Coach Luke Walton has said that the team will be cautious with James, who signed a four-year, $154 million deal in July.For much of his career, James has been able to ward off the corrosive effects of his profession — the daily wear and tear, the punishment from defenders. If nothing else, the last couple of weeks have revealed him to be at least semi-mortal, after all — and the Lakers are taking no chances, hoping they can remain afloat until he returns."
Basketball,"DeMarcus Cousins is scheduled to make his long-anticipated debut with the Golden State Warriors during the team’s Los Angeles road trip later this month, according to two people with knowledge of the team’s plans.The Warriors will play the Clippers on Jan. 18 and the Lakers on Jan. 21, with Cousins expected to make his return from a torn Achilles’ tendon he sustained in January 2018 in one of those two games, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss the situation publicly.After Golden State’s 122-95 rout of the Knicks on Tuesday night, Warriors Coach Steve Kerr would not make any promises but acknowledged that activating Cousins for either Jan. 18 or Jan. 21 is “definitely the range.”“It’s not as simple as, ‘That’s the game’ — it’s somewhere in that neighborhood,” Kerr said. “Now that we are getting closer, like I told you guys yesterday, he’s made some big strides the last week or two, conditioning-wise.”Cousins was in the midst of his best professional season with the New Orleans Pelicans last Jan. 26, when he tore his left Achilles late in a victory over the Houston Rockets.The injury cost Cousins his first career trip to the playoffs after six and a half fruitless seasons with the Sacramento Kings and also led to him signing a one-year, $5.3 million contract with the Warriors in July. The All-Star center found his options limited in free agency amid concerns about how he would recover from such a severe setback.The Warriors have been eager to see Cousins on the floor to finally address what has been one of the league’s most frequently asked questions since they signed him: How will Cousins find a niche in Golden State’s offense alongside four fellow All-Stars in Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green?“He’s a great basketball player in terms of just feel and things like that,” Curry told reporters Tuesday night. “There’s going to be some fun moments out there.“I think with the collective IQ we have in our locker room and just understanding the unselfishness around what we do that we’ll be able to figure it out hopefully quickly. But it’s going to be an adjustment for sure.”Despite a well-chronicled lack of size on its roster, Golden State has been cautious in bringing Cousins back from what has historically been one of the most unforgiving injuries for basketball players. The Warriors have never had the luxury of fielding an offensive-minded center during their run of three championships over the past four years, but the position has been even more problematic this season after the third-year big man Damian Jones, having been moved into an expanded role, suffered a season-ending shoulder injury. Jordan Bell, meanwhile, has struggled to establish a spot in Kerr’s rotation.“It’s exciting,” Thompson said of Cousins’s coming debut. “I know our fan base is excited, the N.B.A. is excited. I can’t wait to integrate him into our team. He adds a whole new dimension, especially on the block. He’s such a handful down there and with his ability to playmake.”When Cousins does finally make it onto the court, Golden State will become the first team since the Boston Celtics in 1975-76 to be able to put five All-Stars from the previous season on the court. The Celtics did it that season with a lineup of Jo Jo White, Charlie Scott, Dave Cowens, Paul Silas and John Havlicek."
Basketball,"Back in November, Mitchell Robinson showed the world what he’s capable of.Robinson, the rookie Knicks center, absorbed contact under the basket from Orlando’s Melvin Frazier and flopped to the court, hoping for a foul that was never called. Instead, the Magic passed the ball around a few times, finding a wide-open Jerian Grant in the corner, 22 feet from a supine Robinson.In three seconds that defied reasonable expectation, Robinson got to his feet, raced toward the corner and leapt into the air. He fully extended his lanky 7-foot-1 frame and swatted the 3-point attempt out of midair so matter-of-factly that Grant pulled his hands toward his body, looking almost sorry that he had attempted the shot.The block was Robinson’s eighth of the game, setting a Knicks rookie record (which he stretched to nine blocks by the end of the night). But beyond the block’s impact in the moment, the play illustrated the 20-year-old’s approach to this season. The perception may be that the Knicks are tanking in hopes of drafting Duke’s Zion Williamson, but for Robinson, any shot an opponent takes is a chance for him to get a block — and he is not going to be cheated out of any of them, even if the shooter is beyond the 3-point line. As a result, a mostly irrelevant team has become must-watch television.The Knicks had not forgotten that November block when the Magic came back to Madison Square Garden on Tuesday. The team posted a video of the play on Twitter, wondering if history would repeat. The post proved prophetic, as Robinson led the way in a 108-103 victory for the Knicks with 17 points, 14 rebounds, 6 blocks and 3 steals in 33 minutes off the bench. Four of the blocks came in just 40 seconds in the second quarter.“The kid is making history right now,” Knicks Coach David Fizdale said of Robinson after the win. “He’s putting himself in groups with historic names. Every single day he continues to grow and get better.”The Knicks’ two-game winning streak ended on Thursday with a disappointing 125-118 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. But even in defeat, Robinson managed to add to his highlight reel, this time with a shot an opponent didn’t take. It was early in the second quarter, and Cavaliers guard Matthew Dellavedova got the ball with a clean look at the basket from 3-point range. As he prepared to shoot, he noticed Robinson a few feet in front of him, with the rookie lowering his shoulder slightly as he prepared to leap. Dellavedova immediately thought better of trying his luck and passed the ball instead. A few seconds later on the same possession, Robinson got his block anyway, swatting away a layup attempt from Marquese Chriss.A rare prep-to-pro N.B.A. player as a result of his complicated withdrawal from Western Kentucky University, Robinson has been limited to 18.6 minutes a game as he works to refine his game, but he is still third in the N.B.A. at 2.3 blocks a game. When rated by block percentage, which estimates the percentage of an opponents’ shots a player blocks in his time on the floor, Robinson is nothing short of stunning, at 10.4 percent.Basketball Reference has tracked block percentage back to the 1973-74 season, and the top-four seasons among players with 100 or more blocks belong to Manute Bol, the 7-foot-7 shot-blocking savant. No. 5 on the list belongs to Robinson. Sample size obviously needs to be considered, but Robinson stands a chance of being the only qualified player beyond Bol and Alonzo Mourning to finish a season with a block percentage higher than 10. Rim protection luminaries such as Serge Ibaka (9.8), Mark Eaton (9.2) and Dikembe Mutombo (8.8) all fell short of that mark in their best seasons. Robinson, who has quickly become a fan favorite, believes he is just getting started. He was asked recently how many shots he could block a game if the team let him play 30 minutes a night. “Probably around six,” he said. “I feel like I can get like six.”The N.B.A. season record for blocks per game is 5.6, set by Eaton in 1984-85, yet Robinson’s boast does not seem all that far-fetched, largely because of his unusual ability to block shots along the perimeter as well as under the basket.“His potential is crazy,” Emmanuel Mudiay, the Knicks guard, told reporters before Thursday’s game. “He’s probably the best shot-blocker I ever played with in my life. In my opinion, he’s the best shot-blocker in the league.”Fizdale has said that Robinson’s confidence and execution have improved since the team acquired DeAndre Jordan to serve as his mentor. The numbers back that up, as Robinson has averaged 11 points, 8.7 rebounds and 3.2 blocks a game since Jordan’s arrival on Jan. 31, while still averaging only 23.1 minutes a night. He has also continued to pester outside shooters, with eight of his 35 blocks in February coming on 3-point attempts. "
Basketball,"Duke was given the No. 1 overall seed in the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s basketball tournament Sunday night, starting Coach Mike Krzyzewski and his star freshman Zion Williamson on a path to what they hope will be the Blue Devils’ sixth national title.Duke (29-5) was one of three Atlantic Coast Conference teams to receive top seeds, joining Virginia (29-3) and North Carolina (27-6). It was the second time members of the same conference were named three of the four No. 1s; the Big East did so in 2009.The fourth No. 1 seed was Gonzaga (30-3), the small stalwart from Spokane, Wash. While the Bulldogs lost the West Coast Conference title game to St. Mary’s last week, they already have a win over Duke on their résumé from a tournament in late November in Hawaii.[Region previews: East | West | South | Midwest]Of course, a top seed is no ticket to the Final Four in Minneapolis. Or even to the second round. Last year, for the first time in 136 such games, a No. 16 seed defeated a No. 1 when the University of Maryland-Baltimore County stunned Virginia.The No. 2 seeds are Michigan State (28-6), Tennessee (29-5), Kentucky (27-6) and Michigan (28-6). The first of these edged the last of these in the Big Ten conference final minutes before the bracket was released. Yet it was the defeated Wolverines who received the privilege of placement in the West alongside Gonzaga, while the Spartans — who won all three games against their in-state rival this season — landed in Duke’s dreaded quadrant.The Blue Devils finished the regular season on a 3-3 skid without Williamson, who sprained his knee when his shoe ripped open during a game on Feb. 20. But Williamson, the prospective No. 1 overall pick in the N.B.A. draft, returned last week, and Duke proceeded to stomp through the A.C.C. tournament. Williamson set the Duke scoring record for that event, with 81 points.The selection committee effectively ignored the non-Williamson .500 squad and instead considered the team that has won every game except for a 2-point loss to Gonzaga and an overtime loss to Syracuse (20-13). It is Duke’s first No. 1 seed since 2015, which is also the last year it won the tournament.“They earned their right to be there,” said the selection committee chairman, Bernard Muir, who is Stanford’s athletic director, when he appeared on CBS’s selection show to discuss the bracket.The most challenging of the four regions appeared to be the South, topped by Virginia. If the Cavaliers get past 16-seeded Gardner-Webb (23-11) on Friday — a game they surely will not take for granted after last year — they could face a No. 8-seeded Mississippi (20-12) that has four wins over tournament teams. Then potential round of 16 opponents include Wisconsin (23-10), underseeded at No. 5, or fourth-seeded Kansas State (25-8), which came close to the Final Four last year.The South final could well feature No. 2-seeded Tennessee (29-5) or No. 3-seeded Purdue (23-9). Both teams are ranked in the top 10 of KenPom.com’s efficiency ratings, a list Virginia sits atop. And either might have home-court advantage at Louisville’s KFC Yum Center.The region also features two prominent conference champions: sixth-seeded Villanova (25-9), the current Big East and defending national champion, and seventh-seeded Cincinnati (28-6), which won the American Athletic Conference tournament on Sunday.In addition to Michigan State, the land mines in the East between Duke and the Final Four could include fourth-seeded Virginia Tech (24-8), which defeated the Williamson-less Blue Devils last month, and third-seeded Louisiana State (26-6), a talented squad that is without Coach Will Wade. He was suspended after a report emerged that he had discussed making an offer to a recruit on a phone call with an aspiring agent convicted of fraud in college recruiting.The East has other ties to scandal. Seventh-seeded Louisville (20-13) faces 10th-seeded Minnesota (21-13) in the first round, a game that might have been a father-son matchup between Rick and Richard Pitino had the former not been let go as Louisville’s coach in 2017 shortly after corruption allegations became public. And L.S.U.’s first game is against No. 14 Yale (21-7), the Ivy League co-champion, whose women’s soccer program was caught up in the admissions scandal that federal prosecutors revealed last week.In the national semifinals, the East winner, which will be determined in Washington, will face the West winner. In addition to Gonzaga and Michigan, contenders in that region include third-seeded Texas Tech (26-6), which was considered the best team in the strong Big 12 but was upset in the conference tournament by West Virginia (14-20); and fourth-seeded Florida State (27-7), which looked every bit Duke’s equal in the first half of the A.C.C. title game on Saturday. The West also features two mid-major darlings: No. 6 Buffalo (31-3) and No. 7 Nevada (29-4). The West Regional is in Anaheim, Calif."
Basketball,"Jimmy Butler knows what’s coming on Saturday night in Minneapolis. He understands, relishes and even encourages the looming prospect of the chilliest welcome any visiting N.B.A. player is bound to receive this season.“They’re going to boo me,” Butler said of the Minnesota fans who watched him force his way out of town via a trade to the Philadelphia 76ers in November — months after Butler led the woebegone Timberwolves to their first playoff berth in 14 seasons.“I would boo me, too. I’m not going to lie to you.”Now a key member of what is widely regarded as the most potent starting lineup on the N.B.A. map outside of Golden State, Butler will be back at Target Center for the first time since the trade turmoil that captivated the league for the first two months of the season.Butler insisted he was unfazed by what awaited him, and went on to suggest that a number of his Philadelphia colleagues, as well as some longtime friends who plan to be in attendance, will partake in the inevitable hostilities.“I might actually join in on the boos,” Butler said.Those who have spent any time around the rugged swingman surely don’t doubt it. At a time when N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver openly frets about player happiness — and when standouts such as Boston’s Kyrie Irving and Golden State’s Kevin Durant routinely rail against the approach of some of the news media — Butler is the rare star who savors the game’s edgy side and has embraced his portrayal as a villain.“I love it,” Butler said in a phone interview, repeating the phrase three times — including once with a profanity for emphasis. “Who wants to be loved all the time?“It’s O.K. It’s fine. I don’t need everybody to like me. I know who I am. I can’t say that enough. I know what I’m about. I know where my heart is. People will say, ‘He’s this way, or he’s that way,’ but nobody knows except for the people around me every day. Ask them and they’ll tell you differently.”Elton Brand, the 76ers’ general manager, certainly falls within that category, describing Butler as “a caring person” who has quickly endeared himself “not only to his teammates but to our whole business operations staff and in the community.”As a first-year general manager, Brand had his own reservations before going through with the first major move of his tenure, having watched chaos engulf the Timberwolves from afar — with no shortage of the noise coming from Butler himself after news leaked of the mid-September trade request he made in private.But when Brand did his research, consulting former coaches and executives who had worked with Butler, along with former players he knew well who had firsthand knowledge, such as Nazr Mohammed and Mike Dunleavy Jr., he received little in the way of dissenting feedback.“Even with the story that was reported, that wasn’t a big deal,” Brand said, referring to an ESPN report in January that asserted Butler “aggressively challenged” Philadelphia Coach Brett Brown. “He didn’t curse. He wasn’t loud. It was his reputation following him.”Butler, 29, admitted in a recent interview with Yahoo Sports’s Chris Haynes that he is a “confrontational” teammate, but that he is also trying to be more selective in showing his blunt nature as he gets older. It should be noted that, as Brand found, Butler has also been a largely popular teammate in his stints with the Chicago Bulls and Team U.S.A. — and, frankly, with numerous Timberwolves apart from the All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns.Butler took a hit in some precincts after informing the since-fired coach with whom he’s so closely associated — Tom Thibodeau — that he was no longer interested in trying to nurture Towns and Andrew Wiggins and wanted out of Minnesota. One example of the damage: Butler is one of the top 12 players in the Eastern Conference, but East coaches snubbed him as a reserve for the All-Star Game in February."
Basketball,"Jim Boeheim, the longtime men’s basketball coach at Syracuse, struck and killed a pedestrian on Wednesday night, the police said.A man had been involved in an earlier accident and had left his car on I-690 near Syracuse. Boeheim drove by later, striking the man, the police said.The victim was Jorge Jimenez, 51, of Syracuse. A police statement said Boeheim had tried to avoid the disabled car in the middle of the road and as a result had “struck the victim who was standing on the side of the road.”A police statement said that neither driver was impaired by drugs or alcohol. It said Boeheim’s speed had not been determined. While no tickets had been issued, an investigation was being conducted, it said.The area was under a weather advisory for snow and ice conditions.“I am heartbroken that a member of our community died as the result of last night’s accident,” Boeheim said in a statement. “Juli and I extend our deepest sympathies to the Jimenez family. Out of respect for those involved, I will not be providing further comment at this time.”“We are saddened by the death of a member of our Central New York community,” said John Wildhack, the Syracuse athletic director. “Coach Boeheim is in contact with local authorities and cooperating fully.”Boeheim, 74, has been the coach at Syracuse since 1976, winning a national championship in 2003 and logging four other Final Four appearances over the years.Earlier in the evening, Syracuse (18-8) had beaten No. 18 Louisville, 69-49."
Basketball,"[Want to read more from Marc Stein? Sign up for his free, weekly N.B.A. newsletter by clicking here.]Four of the six best records in the N.B.A. belonged to Eastern Conference teams through Saturday night’s play.The Golden State Warriors, meanwhile, reached the 41-game midpoint of the schedule on a pedestrian (for them) 54-win pace.The first half of the regular season, in other words, has defied most preseason prognostications and requires special examination to properly sort out the 1-to-30 landscape. So it is an ideal time to reconvene what is known as the Committee (of One) and share my team-by-team progress report in the form of N.B.A. Power Rankings.The Committee, as it has since the 2002-03 season, determines the order by weighing what is happening in the present alongside each team’s big-picture outlook — with sprinkles of subjectivity and whimsy thrown in.What used to be a weekly endeavor for me is only a once-a-season enterprise every January now. Yet the goal, as always, is to provide a more up-to-date and detailed assessment than the standings do.(Records and statistics are current heading into Sunday’s games.)1. Toronto Raptors (32-12)The Raptors were this season’s first 30-win team, which is impressive when Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry have been in uniform together only three times in Toronto’s last 17 games. The threat of the Los Angeles Clippers signing Leonard away in free agency is all too real for every basketball-loving Canadian, but the Raptors may still assemble the best possible sales pitch: Win the post-LeBron James Eastern Conference to get to the N.B.A. finals and give Leonard ample reason to stay.2. Milwaukee Bucks (29-12)Giannis Antetokounmpo supplanting James Harden as the league’s Most Valuable Player? Mike Budenholzer emerging from the usual deep field to win N.B.A. Coach of the Year? Milwaukee clinching the East’s No. 1 seed heading into the playoffs? Any of those would have been fairly wild claims back in September, but suddenly they all seem possible halfway through the regular-season schedule. The challenge now: Milwaukee is just beginning the toughest two months of its schedule.3. Golden State Warriors (28-14) Maybe the Warriors do not inspire the fear they once did. Maybe their defensive woes (having slipped to 16th in defensive efficiency) are a sign of true vulnerability. Or maybe, with DeMarcus Cousins just days away from making his long-awaited debut, Golden State’s season is about to start for real. I tend to believe it is the latter, in Year 5 of a historic run, having seen firsthand how much this team can struggle with regular-season motivation.[Read: DeMarcus Cousins Eyes Return as Warriors Prepare for 5-All-Star Lineup]4. Denver Nuggets (28-13)The regular season is just under 90 days old. The plucky Nuggets, despite numerous injuries, have held the top spot in the West — Golden State’s conference — for 44 of them. Yet you would not know it given the limited attention these guys get, as N.B.A. know-it-alls wrestle with billing Denver as a full-fledged contender — or dismissing them as a team that can only do pre-April damage. Book this either way: Nikola Jokic is a lock to snag his first All-Star berth."
Basketball,"LOS ANGELES — At the end of a disastrous season in which the Los Angeles Lakers failed to make the playoffs, despite having added LeBron James via free agency, Magic Johnson made the stunning announcement on Tuesday that he was stepping down as the team’s president of basketball operations.Johnson delivered the news at an impromptu news conference before the Lakers’ regular-season finale, against the Portland Trail Blazers, and he said he had not yet informed Jeanie Buss, the team’s controlling owner. In fact, he had told nearly no one before he addressed a mass of hastily assembled reporters.“I couldn’t face her to tell her,” he said, referring to Buss. He later added that he would find her at Staples Center to address her in person.Later, the team released a statement, calling Johnson “not only a Lakers icon, but our family.”[Magic Johnson’s biggest moments running the Lakers.]“There is no greater Los Angeles Laker than Earvin Johnson,” the statement read, using Johnson’s formal name. “We are deeply grateful to Magic for all that he has done for our franchise — as a player, an ambassador and an executive.”The statement continued, “As we begin the process of moving forward, we will work in a measured and methodical fashion to make the right moves for the future of our organization.”“Measured” and “methodical” would be an about-face from the way Johnson stepped down. It was a surreal scene as he fielded questions for nearly 45 minutes after he made his announcement, appearing to hold back tears at times, and repeatedly said that he loved Buss like a sister. He then posed for pictures with team employees, former teammates and a local news anchor.“I want to go back to having fun,” Johnson, 59, said. “I want to go back to being who I was before taking on this job, and we’re halfway there with LeBron coming. I think this summer, with that other star coming in — whoever’s going to come in — I think this team is going to be in position to really contend for a championship with the growth of the other young players.”Johnson was named to the post in February 2017 and said at the time that it was “a dream come true.” But on Tuesday he said that he wanted to get back to being a mentor and a businessman, and that he had felt limited in his ability to do those things in his current role.For example, he said he was upset that he could not attend Dwyane Wade’s final game for the Miami Heat on Tuesday night — or congratulate Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder on Twitter for finishing the regular season averaging another triple-double. (Johnson said the league would have considered it “tampering.”)Johnson also said that he had received a phone call last week from the tennis star Serena Williams, asking if he would be an adviser to her.“When Serena called me, wow, that’s who I am,” Johnson said. “I love helping people.”He added: “I like to be free. And then I got a great life outside of this. What am I doing? I got a beautiful life, so I’m going to go back to that beautiful life, and I’m looking forward to it.”But there is palace intrigue at play, too — these are the Lakers, after all — and Johnson strongly indicated that he had been leaning toward firing Coach Luke Walton. Buss, though, is known to think highly of Walton, a former Laker who has been the team’s coach for three seasons, and Johnson suggested that he did not want to go through with it."
Basketball,"There was no Instagram post celebrating the achievement in advance this time. There was relatively little buildup from the news media. It was an event that might have dominated the news cycle in years’ past, but when LeBron James passed Michael Jordan on the N.B.A.’s career scoring list on Wednesday night, it was a triumph that somehow had been reduced to a footnote.James came into the Los Angeles Lakers’ game against the Denver Nuggets needing 13 points to surpass Jordan for fourth place on the career list. With 5 minutes 38 seconds remaining in the second quarter, he managed to force his way to the basket for a layup, giving him 14 points for the game and 32,294 for his career. For good measure, he was fouled on the play. After a short stoppage to acknowledge the moment, play resumed as the Lakers, clinging to the last shreds of their playoff hopes, tried their best to overcome a huge early deficit at home against a heavily favored opponent.The Lakers, led by an unlikely group of bench players, did make a run at Denver, reducing a 17-point deficit at halftime to 2 points with 8:37 left in the fourth quarter. But the Nuggets regained their footing and ran away with a 115-99 victory, spoiling a night in which James contributed 31 points, 7 rebounds and 7 assists, looking far more energized on both ends of the court than he had in recent weeks, and finishing the night with his career point total up to 32,311. James, who has taken the brunt of the criticism for the Lakers’ failings in a difficult first year in Los Angeles, had acknowledged the pending accomplishment in a tweet shortly before the game, but was measured when discussing it with reporters earlier in the day.“I take all accomplishments as they come,” he said. “Any time I’m in the breath with any other greats — and obviously M.J. being the guy that I looked up to my whole life, the guy I admired as a kid — I think it’s going to be pretty cool.”Jordan, who owns the Charlotte Hornets, issued a brief statement on Thursday, saying, “I want to congratulate LeBron on achieving another great milestone during his amazing career.” The statement was notable mostly for being far more succinct than the one he issued when Kobe Bryant passed him on the career scoring list in 2014.One would hardly have guessed from either man’s words that the greatest current basketball player had just surpassed his idol in their sport’s signature statistic. The inability for James to truly celebrate the moment was yet another indignity in a season full of them.It was a little more than a year ago when James had seemingly settled into a groove. He scored his 30,000th point — a feat he congratulated himself about on Instagram hours before he actually accomplished it. With that hurdle cleared, and with recent championship runs in Miami and Cleveland under his belt, his march toward challenging Jordan, then Bryant, then Karl Malone and maybe even Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the N.B.A.’s career scoring leader, seemed as if it would come without the criticism that had followed him earlier in his career.A decision — a loaded word when it comes to James — to move to an ill-prepared Lakers team in the off-season has changed the calculus altogether. The team was predicted by most to struggle to make the playoffs in the West thanks to its collection of too-young players and veterans who do not complement James. Nevertheless, many have labeled the year a disappointment by virtue of the team’s struggles despite having James, a player whose presence has seemingly guaranteed a finals appearance for close to a decade.As a result, James and the people around him have not been able to take much joy in his accomplishments. Just last week he passed Andre Miller to move into 10th place in career assists, thus making him the only player currently in the top 10 in both career points and assists. That feat — it had been temporarily attained by only a handful of other players going back to the days of Bob Cousy — was met with a collective shrug.It is a reality of James’s life that he acknowledged on Wednesday.“I haven’t really appreciated anything I’ve been able to accomplish because I’m so engulfed in what’s next,” he said. “How I can continue to get better; how I can help this franchise get back to where it needs to be.”An occasional season of missing the playoffs is not unusual for most players — even the great ones — but to capture how truly rare it would be for a James-led team, consider that he has played double-digit playoff games in each of the last 13 years. He has appeared in nine N.B.A. finals — winning three — and as a result his career rankings among playoff performers come off as outrageous, even for someone as accomplished as James. Those rankings almost certainly will not improve this year. But among the more interesting aspects of James’s current predicament is the opinion among many Lakers fans that the team’s struggles have resulted in James’s failing to live up to Bryant’s legacy. Those criticisms ignore the fact that the Lakers’ current six-year run of missing the playoffs included three seasons in which Bryant was still with the team. "
Basketball,"LOS ANGELES — Knicks center Enes Kanter said on Friday that he would not travel with the team to play the Washington Wizards in London on Jan. 17 because he feared retaliation for his public opposition to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.Kanter, who is Turkish, has been an outspoken critic of the president for years.“Sadly, I’m not going because of that freaking lunatic, the Turkish president,” Kanter said after the Knicks’ 119-112 victory over the Lakers. “It’s pretty sad that all the stuff affects my career and basketball because I want to be out there and help my team win. But just because of the one lunatic guy, one maniac, one dictator, I can’t even go out there and do my job. It’s pretty sad.”Kanter said Turkish operatives could present a danger to him in London.“They have a lot of spies there,” he said. “I could get killed there easy.”An official at the Turkish Embassy in Washington, speaking Saturday on the condition of anonymity to abide by diplomatic protocol, dismissed Kanter’s comments as baseless.A Knicks official later said that Kanter would not be traveling to London because of a visa issue.In May 2017, Kanter was detained for several hours at an airport in Romania after the Turkish government canceled his travel documents. Later that year, Turkey’s state-run news agency reported that prosecutors were seeking more than four years in jail for Kanter on charges that he had insulted Erdogan on social media."
Basketball,"No Chris Paul. No Eric Gordon. No Clint Capela. No problem. The Houston Rockets still have James Harden.In a mind-boggling performance, Harden and his supporting cast — if you can call it that — managed to beat the Memphis Grizzlies by 112-94 at Houston’s Toyota Center, with Harden scoring 57 points in 34 minutes.It was the 17th game in a row in which Harden scored at least 30 points — a feat previously accomplished in a single season by only Wilt Chamberlain — and it was Harden’s third game of 50 or more points this season. No other player has more than one.Coach Mike D’Antoni may have recorded the 600th win of his N.B.A. career in the game, but he was more interested in making sure people recognized the greatness of Harden’s feat.“What he just did, we kind of take it for granted a little bit,” D’Antoni told reporters. “It’s like, ‘Oh, look at that, isn’t that cute?’ It’s 57!” Harden, however, tried to keep the focus on Houston continuing to climb in the standings, and making up for Sunday’s loss to Orlando.“I don’t know if it was an emotional lift,” Harden told reporters of Monday’s win, “but I know it’s crunchtime in the sense that we’ve got three starters out and guys have got to pick up the slack. There’s no excuse.”While the outburst was hardly unexpected for Harden, who is now averaging an N.B.A.-leading 34.8 points a game, the Rockets’ personnel situation made it stand out. Paul has been out with an injured hamstring since Dec. 20 and Gordon has been out with an injured knee since Dec. 29. Houston’s injury report then took on what seemed like a crippling blow earlier on Monday when it was revealed that Capela, the team’s center — and the most frequent recipient of Harden’s assists — would be out for four to six weeks as a result of ligament damage in his right thumb.That list of injuries left Harden starting alongside the forgettable quartet of P.J. Tucker, Nene, Austin Rivers and Danuel House Jr. No matter, as Harden joined Kemba Walker as the only players to score more than half of their team’s points in a game this season.Harden was hot from the start, setting a Rockets record with 36 points in the first half, and he succeeded all game with his typical combination of 3-pointers (6 for 15) and free-throws (17 for 18). He also led all players in the game with nine rebounds and committed just five turnovers despite his outrageous level of usage.The last time Harden scored fewer than 30 points was Dec. 11 in Houston’s win over the Portland Trail Blazers, and he just barely missed the feat that night, with 29 points on 10 of 21 shooting. Since then he has averaged 41.3 points a game over the 17 games in which the Rockets, who got off to a poor start this season, have gone 13-4.In the 17 games, Harden has topped 50 points twice and 40 points 10 times. He has also recorded five triple-doubles.While Harden’s performance on Monday broke his tie with Kobe Bryant and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the N.B.A.’s longest single-season streak of 30-plus points by a player not named Chamberlain, Harden has a long way to go before catching Wilt.Chamberlain had 30-point streaks, of 20, 25, 31 and 65 games in his career, according to Basketball-Reference.com. The longest one, which came during the 1961-62 season, is likely an unbreakable record, but it comes with an amusing footnote: In Chamberlain’s last game before the streak started, he was held to 28 points in a loss to Bill Russell’s Boston Celtics. When the streak finally ended more than three months later, Chamberlain was held to 26 points — in a loss to Russell’s Celtics.As it currently stands, though, Harden does not appear to have a foil that can be his version of Russell, so there is no telling when this streak will end."
Basketball,"LOS ANGELES — Vast upheaval within the Los Angeles Lakers organization continued on Friday afternoon when the team announced that Luke Walton was stepping down as coach.The Lakers said in a statement that Walton and the team had “mutually agreed to part ways,” without elaborating. The news came three days after Magic Johnson, the team’s president for basketball operations, made the surprise announcement that he was resigning so he could devote more time to his business interests.Walton, 39, was in his third season with the Lakers, who were expected to vie for a playoff spot after signing LeBron James, a four-time N.B.A. most valuable player, to a four-year, $154 million contract last July. Instead, the Lakers scuffled to a 37-45 record after months of general dysfunction and momentum-sapping injuries. They finished 10th in the Western Conference, well out of playoff position.The N.B.A.’s postseason will start Saturday but without the Lakers, whose postseason drought is now at six seasons. Not even the celebrated addition of James could salvage this one, but he missed significant time with a groin injury. And even when he was on the court, he appeared detached from his teammates as weeks of misery mounted.The Lakers are fraught with problems. When Johnson announced that he was quitting this week, he indicated that he had been planning to fire Walton and that he had the support of Jeanie Buss, the team’s controlling owner, to go forward with the move. But then Johnson resigned — in part, he said, because he could not go through with affecting someone’s “livelihood.”Hours later, after the Lakers had closed out their season with a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, Walton said that he was looking forward to an eventful summer with the team in hopes of making improvements. Now he is gone, too, though he may not be unemployed for long.The Sacramento Kings immediately responded to Friday’s news by reaching out to Walton’s representatives to arrange an interview for their coaching vacancy, according to two people familiar with Sacramento’s plans who were not authorized to discuss them publicly. Walton is considered the front-runner to replace Dave Joerger, whom the Kings fired this week.Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, expressed his support for Walton, one of his former assistants.“In this job, as a coach in the N.B.A., you are 100 percent dependent on your circumstances: the strength of your organization, the momentum, unity,” Kerr told reporters in Oakland, Calif. “Everything has to be in good order, because if it’s not, as we have witnessed with the Lakers, then there’s going to be casualties, and usually the coach is the first one.”He added: “They’re losing one of the best humans in the N.B.A. They’re losing a guy who knows the game as well as anybody I’ve met. They’re losing somebody who players believe in.”Walton, the son of the Hall of Fame center Bill Walton, was working with an ill-conceived roster that lacked depth, defense and perimeter shooting. Still, the pressure was on him before the season even began. Once the Lakers got off to a slow start, Johnson chastised Walton in a closed-door meeting, raising speculation that Walton was already on the hot seat.Questions about Walton’s job security persisted throughout the season as he shuffled rotations and lineups, searching for solutions that never materialized.Walton refused to make excuses — publicly, he was a voice of unwavering optimism amid a sea of discontent — but it hardly helped that the Lakers were troubled by injuries, especially at point guard.Then there was James, who had been incredibly durable in his 16-year career. But during the Lakers’ Christmas Day game against the Warriors, he limped off the court with a strained groin and missed the next 17 games. Without him, the Lakers struggled. The hope was that they could regain their footing once he returned, but he was not the cure-all anyone imagined. The Lakers continued to lose with James back in the lineup, even though he said he had “activated” himself for a playoff push.It had become clear by then, however, that the Lakers did not have any discernible chemistry, especially after Johnson and Rob Pelinka, their general manager, tried and failed to acquire the All-Star center Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans ahead of February’s trade deadline. (It was no coincidence, perhaps, that Davis and James shared an agent, Rich Paul.) The Lakers were willing to send the Pelicans several of their promising young players, including Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball, but were rebuffed in their attempts to swing a blockbuster deal."
Basketball,"And the Oscar goes to … the Knicks?Not quite. But the team — and its woeful state as one of the worst teams in the N.B.A. — did get a shout out during the Academy Awards on Sunday night.When Samuel L. Jackson came out with Brie Larson to present the Best Adapted Screenplay award at the Oscars, he had a short preamble, a personal message to Spike Lee, a nominee and a famously devoted Knicks fan through thick and thin.“First of all, Spike, so glad you’re sitting down,” Jackson began. “After 18 consecutive home losses, the Knicks won tonight. I repeat, the Knicks won tonight, defeated San Antonio, 130-118”Jackson’s stats were accurate. The 18-game home losing streak had set a franchise record.Jackson’s news flash drew a laugh from Lee, and also an exclamation. It was not audible on the broadcast, but just about every armchair lip reader believed he said, “We’re trying to tank.”While you might think that the end of a long losing streak would delight a superfan like Lee, there are those Knicks supporters out there who don’t especially want to win many — or any — more games.If the Knicks finish in the bottom three of the N.B.A., they will get the best possible chance, 14 percent, to land the top draft pick in June. A recent injury aside, that is still expected to be the Duke star Zion Williamson. A bottom three finish would also give the Knicks a 40 percent chance at a top three pick.As of Monday morning, the Knicks stand at 12-48, for the second worst record. Despite their win, they look likely to grab a bottom three spot, probably alongside the Phoenix Suns (11-50) and Cleveland Cavaliers (14-46). But the Chicago Bulls are looming, two games “better” than the Cavs.The league actually changed the draft lottery percentages this season in an effort to cut down on tanking, particularly after the 76ers went on a multiyear losing period of terrible play that got them several top picks. A year ago, the worst record offered a full 25 percent chance at No. 1, with the second and third worst teams getting 20 and 16 percent chances.Lee has been the Knicks’ consensus No. 1 fan for years, sitting courtside and not infrequently interacting with players on both teams. Perhaps most infamously, in 1994, he jawed with the Pacers’ Reggie Miller in a conference finals game. Miller went on to the lead the Pacers to victory, drawing a “Thanks a Lot Spike” headline from The New York Daily News.Jackson and Lee have a history as well, with Jackson appearing in “Do the Right Thing,” “School Daze,” “Jungle Fever” and “Mo Better Blues.” They are also both alumni of Morehouse College.In this age of smartphones, there’s a good chance that those at the Oscars who cared already knew the Knicks score, perhaps including Lee.That wasn’t the case in 1976, when Elliott Gould, presenting the award for best editing, alerted the audience that Indiana had won the men’s basketball national championship, 86-68. “I listened to the score before we went out to make the presentation,” he told Grantland. “Literally in the wings, there was a radio there.”By the way, along with his co-writers, Lee won on Sunday, his first competitive Oscar. There is no evidence that “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs” or the other nominees engaged in any tanking."
Basketball,"Knicks Coach David Fizdale pulled at the edge of his graying beard as he dissected his team’s latest blowout loss. Leading a team that is now 10-42, the worst record in the N.B.A., Fizdale has had to search hard for traces of sunshine.As he answered questions from reporters at a recent postgame news conference, the frames of his trademark glasses looked as broken as the franchise itself. The damaged black frames were held together by a glop of glue; Fizdale had cracked them earlier in the season.It is easy to say now, but with 30 games remaining the Knicks seem to have been lost from the start. They began the season with the youngest roster in the N.B.A., with an average age of less than 24.5 years old. Development became the mantra with Fizdale, who in his first season as the Knicks head coach has frequently referred to his players as “kids.” Inexperience, a revolving-door rotation, and the absence of Kristaps Porzingis — the star forward who has been out injured since February 2018 — compounded the losing.Now, after last week’s trade that sent Porzingis to the Dallas Mavericks ended any hope that he might return to save the season, the Knicks could be in danger of finishing with the worst record in franchise history. The low mark was a 17-65 record during the 2014-15 season. They have lost 13 in a row, 25 of the last 27 and a franchise-record 14 consecutive games at home. Not surprisingly, they were 27th in the league in offensive rating and 28th in defensive rating entering Monday night’s games.Of course, Knicks fans have become inured to the losing — this will be the team’s sixth consecutive season without a winning record. Other than the 2012-13 season, when the Knicks reached the Eastern Conference semifinals, it has been nearly two decades since the team advanced beyond the first round of the playoffs.Newcomers like Kevin Knox, Mitchell Robinson and Allonzo Trier may be the future, but injuries and inconsistency have marred the present. Knox, the 6-foot-9 forward chosen ninth over all in last year’s draft, is one of the youngest players in the league, at 19. In December he earned Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month honors, but his 37.1 shooting percentage needs to improve.The Knicks took a gamble on the 7-foot-1 Robinson when they selected him in the second round of June’s draft, 36th over all. He was the only player in last year’s draft who did not play in college, overseas or in the N.B.A.’s developmental league. Instead, Robinson took a year off from organized basketball after high school to get ready for the draft.Trier, a 6-foot-5 guard, went undrafted after three seasons at Arizona, but his early impressive play led to a two-year, $7 million deal with the Knicks.The Knicks’ front office has been lauded for its savvy picks in last year’s draft and its recent acquisition of reclamation projects. That acumen will be tested in June. The Knicks, who own a first-round draft pick, will have the chance to select an impact player with their winning-by-losing approach.The more they lose, the better their chances are of landing Duke’s Zion Williamson or another highly coveted prospect. Still, it is not a slam dunk — even if the Knicks fail to win 20 games this year. Being the worst team in the N.B.A. used to provide a greater advantage in the draft lottery. Because the league changed the rule to deter teams from tanking, the bottom three teams now share the same 14 percent odds of winning the No. 1 pick. Previously, the worst team held a 25 percent chance.“Obviously, you always want to win. Every game we play we’re trying to win,” Fizdale has said.But what if the Knicks actually did start winning, boosted by the three players acquired in the Porzingis trade with Dallas? The Knicks gained the promising guard Dennis Smith Jr., who was a first-round draft pick in 2017, and the expiring contracts of the veterans DeAndre Jordan and Wesley Matthews, plus two future first-round picks. Porzingis, Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee and Trey Burke were shipped to the Mavericks.The Knicks’ newcomers knew only a few of the team’s offensive plays before making their debut against Memphis on Sunday, with Smith Jr. and Jordan starting. Both made standout plays early. Smith scored his first basket on a drive into the lane with an up-and-under layup and added another in a fast-break opportunity. Jordan registered a block, followed by an alley-oop dunk off an assist from Smith. All this competent basketball made some Knicks fans nervous, leading to some angst-ridden gallows humor on social media.The Knicks held on for the loss, 96-84.With Smith and Jordan in the starting lineup, the Knicks have continued their season theme of roster roulette. Fizdale has stitched together 57 five-man lineups that have played 10 or more minutes together this season. But of those groups, only five lineups have played 50 or more minutes together."
Basketball,"NEW ORLEANS — The New Orleans Pelicans have scuffled along for years as one of the N.B.A.’s worker-bee franchises, a respectable team but not one that has vied for championships. They lose as often as they win and play their home games in an arena called the Smoothie King Center, where a big-beaked mascot named Pierre roams the crowd.But in recent seasons, the team has employed someone even more special: Anthony Davis, a gifted center and one of the best players in the league. Davis has a pterodactyl-length wingspan and a unibrow, which has become as much a part of his persona as his skyscraping dunks. Fans know him as “The Brow,” as if he were a superhero who draws strength from his facial hair.New Orleans used to love him for it — until two weeks ago, when he shook the league and asked the Pelicans to trade him. The Pelicans, in return, made a bold move of their own: They refused to let him go, at least not yet.Now Davis and New Orleans are stuck together in basketball purgatory — “It definitely is different,” said Jrue Holiday, the team’s starting point guard — and the city’s long-suffering sports fans can only wonder: What do we do now?“It’s not a new thing that guys demand to be traded,” Alvin Gentry, the Pelicans coach, said in an interview, “but I thought the timing of it kind of put everybody in a tough situation.”It has been a soul-crushing few weeks for sports fans here. They absorbed a major blow last month when the New Orleans Saints, who are as much a tent revival as football team, lost to the Los Angeles Rams in the N.F.L. playoffs after a missed call by the referees, which may have cost the Saints a trip to the Super Bowl.A week later, Davis’s agent, Rich Paul, announced publicly that Davis wanted out of New Orleans and would not sign a contract extension.“Now that he’s going to leave, I’m excited to see what we can get for him,” said Ryan Bergeron, a 22-year-old legal assistant from New Orleans who is a regular at Pelicans games. Like many fans, Bergeron owns one of Davis’s replica jerseys — which he plans to keep in the back of his closet.“I think we’ll be better off without him,” Bergeron said.Not so long ago, Davis was throwing beads from a float as an honorary grand marshal at a Mardi Gras parade. But the city’s feelings toward him have curdled like week-old étouffée.On Friday night, when Davis played in his first home game for the Pelicans since his trade request, images of him were cut from a highlight package that played on the arena’s oversize video screens. The crowd showered him with boos that drowned out scattered cheers. As if to amplify his value while sticking it to those who expressed their displeasure, Davis collected 32 points and 9 rebounds.“It’s life, man,” Davis said of his frosty reception. “Some people aren’t going to like you.”New Orleans has dealt with its share of hardwood hardship. Franchises have come and gone, along with star players. The New Orleans Buccaneers were a charter member of the American Basketball Association from 1967 to 1970, but then relocated to Memphis. The New Orleans Jazz, founded as an N.B.A. expansion franchise in 1974, had a similarly abbreviated run before decamping for Utah in 1979.The N.B.A. returned to New Orleans in 2002 — back when the team was known as the Hornets — and eventually found a franchise star in point guard Chris Paul, who led the team to three playoff appearances before he, too, told management before the start of the 2011-12 season that he would not sign a contract extension. New Orleans traded him to the Los Angeles Clippers, then finished with the worst record in the Western Conference.But from the rubble of player discontent sprang fresh life in 2012: Tom Benson, then the owner of the Saints, bought the franchise, and the team, soon to be rebranded as the Pelicans, secured the top pick in the draft. (After Benson died last year, the ownership of both franchises was transferred to his wife, Gayle.) New Orleans used that pick on Davis, a freshman center who had just led Kentucky to an N.C.A.A. championship."
Basketball,"DALLAS — Moments before the home team was introduced on Monday night, Kristaps Porzingis made his usual walk behind the scorer’s table to take a seat on the Dallas Mavericks’ bench at American Airlines Center.Wearing a three-piece olive suit and a maroon tie, Porzingis saluted a friendly face in the crowd and proceeded to what has become his customary vantage point. It was Porzingis’s 13th home game as a spectator since Dallas acquired him from the Knicks on Feb. 1, as he continues to recover from a serious knee injury he sustained in February 2018.Porzingis, in other words, projected normalcy in his first public appearance since it emerged that he is under investigation by law enforcement authorities in New York City over an accusation that he sexually assaulted a woman there.As the Mavericks reveled in an unforeseen 16 points and 14 rebounds from the reserve center Salah Mejri, Porzingis was right in the heart of multiple bench celebrations. Coach Rick Carlisle had given Porzingis the option of taking personal time away from the team to escape the glare of the spotlight, but Porzingis declined. He wants to keep practicing, Carlisle said, and uphold his rooting routine through the final five games of the Mavericks’ third successive season of missing the playoffs.These, of course, are not normal times for the Mavericks — not when Porzingis, whom they acquired just 60 days ago to serve as a cornerstone for the franchise alongside the electric Slovene rookie Luka Doncic, is facing such grave allegations.Porzingis’s lawyer, Roland G. Riopelle, “unequivocally” denied the accusation and revealed that he formally referred the accuser to the F.B.I. in December for what he termed her “extortionate demands.”The New York Police Department and the Manhattan district attorney’s office have confirmed an investigation is underway, but representatives have declined to comment further. The woman filed a complaint on Thursday that accused Porzingis of sexually assaulting her in his Manhattan apartment on Feb. 7, 2018 — mere hours after he sustained the debilitating knee injury.The woman did not respond to several phone calls requesting comment.For the Mavericks — one season removed from a sexual harassment scandal that led to multiple firings and an overhaul of the franchise’s business and human resources departments — the case has invited fresh scrutiny of a trade for a marquee player who is the subject of a serious criminal complaint.Complicating matters for the Mavericks is their assertion that they cannot comment on the investigation. Before Monday’s unexpected victory over the short-handed Philadelphia 76ers, the Mavericks’ owner, Mark Cuban, reiterated to a group of reporters that the team was told by federal authorities not to comment about the case. The F.B.I. declined to comment.“I’ve got nothing to say — n-o-t-h-i-n-g,” Cuban said, spelling out the word and repeating a stance he has maintained since the allegations against Porzingis were first revealed Saturday night. “When I said federal authorities said for us not to comment, they were being serious.”Cuban and other Mavericks officials have referred all Porzingis-related questions to the N.B.A. The league office, however, has not responded to requests for further elaboration from The New York Times beyond its brief initial statement, from the N.B.A. spokesman Mike Bass, that “we are aware of the situation.”Riopelle said he had provided the district attorney’s office with materials that show the woman attempted to extort Porzingis.“We are confident that after the district attorney reviews these materials, they will recognize that the complaint in this case is completely meritless,” Riopelle said.Porzingis’s camp has received public backing from Michele Roberts, executive director of the National Basketball Players Association and a former trial lawyer."
Basketball,"Attention, couples everywhere: We’ve got some relationship advice from a New York couple who shared a familiar table in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday night, celebrating their 20th anniversary.Beyoncé and Jay-Z? Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick? Jessica and Jerry Seinfeld?Nope. Nope. Nope.Mike Breen and Walt Frazier (known as Clyde)?Yep and yep.However, their table was not covered with a white linen tablecloth and candles, but rather statistics sheets, laptops and a video monitor.Mr. Breen, 57, and Mr. Frazier, his 73-year-old partner-in-rhyme, have been a New York Knicks broadcasting team on MSG Networks for two decades.They recently discussed the keys to maintaining their rock-solid relationship, which began on television on Feb. 5, 1999, at Orlando, back when Mr. Frazier was a precocious neophyte (a phrase he uses to describe promising rookies, which happens to be one of Mr. Breen’s favorite Frazierisms).“To me, the most important aspects of any partnership are respect and concern,” said Mr. Frazier, an All-Star guard in his heyday — he was voted one of the 50 greatest players ever — who led the Knicks to their two N.B.A. titles, in 1970 and 1973.“Mike and I not only have a mutual respect, but we care about each other, and each other’s families,” said Mr. Frazier, who lives in Harlem with his longtime girlfriend, Patricia James. “I know that if I had a problem personally or professionally, Mike would be the first one there for me, and vice versa.”Rosanne Breen, who in September will celebrate an even longer time with Mr. Breen (their 30th wedding anniversary), said that listening to her husband and Mr. Frazier on the air “is like listening to a couple of relatives chatting on the phone.”“My favorite aspect of their relationship is how kind they are to one another, and how their admiration for each other comes across specifically through humor,” Ms. Breen said. “I think at least once a broadcast there’s some sort of very organic and natural interaction between them that ends up with one of them belly laughing, and I find that makes the broadcast really pleasant to listen to.”Mr. Frazier, who is better known to a legion of younger hoops fans for his colorful wardrobe and lyrical analysis — “The Knicks were crashing and dashing in the first half, now they’re stumbling and bumbling,” he said during a telecast earlier this season and possibly many other times this season — was again seated alongside Mr. Breen at the Knicks broadcast table on Tuesday when the Detroit Pistons arrived at Madison Square Garden.Mr. Breen, a lifelong Knicks fan whose sports idol was, and still is, Mr. Frazier, said that “maintaining a sense of humor” has also been crucial to achieving their long-term success.“We both enjoy laughing together on the air,” said Mr. Breen, who noted that an action poster of Mr. Frazier still hangs in the bedroom of the Westchester home where he grew up, and where his mother lives."
Basketball,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]New York already holds Guinness World Records for the most billionaires and for being the most Instagrammed city. Now the city can claim another record: the world’s tallest politician, thanks to Robert Cornegy Jr., a city councilman who represents Brooklyn.A former professional basketball player who was part of the 1984-85 St. John’s University men’s basketball team that advanced to the Final Four, Mr. Cornegy, 53, officially tops out at 6-foot-10, according to an average of measurements provided by three doctors at Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn.“What I went through to get this measurement was borderline ridiculous,” said Mr. Cornegy, who will receive the designation on Wednesday at a ceremony at City Hall. “But I think it was worth it to bring that designation to New York — and Brooklyn.”Getting certified as “the world’s tallest politician (male)” was no easy feat. Guinness requires the record-holder to submit official height verification. Mr. Cornegy went to his former trainer at St. John’s University, but Guinness did not like the tools the trainer used. He then turned to the doctors at Interfaith, which is in his Council district.Mr. Cornegy received three measurements on the same day in January, but at different times and in varied poses. “Medically, there can be variations in height depending on certain factors,” said Dr. Mazin Khalid, who has practiced internal medicine at Interfaith for five years and provided one of the measurements.Mr. Cornegy’s height was recorded while he was lying on the floor, which generally produces a greater measurement because it relieves pressure on the vertebrae, and while he was standing with his heels and shoulders against a wall.“He’s very tall,” Dr. Khalid said. “It took three people to take the measurement.”Guinness officials said Mr. Cornegy is now the official record-holder, besting Sir Louis Gluckstein, a London politician who died in 1979, by two and a half inches. (The most recent record-holder was Archie Hamilton, a 6-foot-6 former member of the British Parliament, who slightly eclipses another New Yorker: the almost 6-foot-6 Mayor Bill de Blasio.)“When I first started this, I said there is no way I’m the tallest politician in the world. There must be an ambassador in Africa who is seven feet,” said Mr. Cornegy. “But when I found out the previous record-holder was only 6 foot 7 inches, I had to give it a shot.”Being that tall has personal costs. Mr. Cornegy paid a contractor to put his toilet at home on an eight-inch platform. “I want to see what it’s like for my feet to swing,” he said.Custom suits cost $700 and stylish shoes, at size 17, are at least $400, he said. Most cars are too small, so Mr. Cornegy rides the subway from his district in Bedford-Stuyvesant to City Hall. But unless he can get a seat, he spends most of the ride hunched over.“I have a moment of anxiety when the train pulls into the station,” he said.When talking to constituents, Mr. Cornegy, who has a master’s degree in organizational leadership, has learned to stand back at least three feet to make it easier for people to look up at him.Mr. de Blasio is the only local politician who comes close to seeing Mr. Cornegy eye to eye. The mayor was signing a bill in 2014 when Mr. Cornegy, then newly elected, walked into the room. “Look who’s here. Rob Cornegy, my archnemesis,” Mr. Cornegy recalled the mayor saying. But the two tallest men in New York politics get along pretty well."
Basketball,"Unhappy with mere tanking, displeased with their success at earning the N.B.A.’s worst record, the Knicks took Kristaps Porzingis, their once-in-a-generation asset, their most, and perhaps only, popular player, and traded him to the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday for potsherds and trinkets.Actually, point of information: Porzingis was not even the center of the transaction. The Knicks tossed him in as a sweetener to persuade the Mavericks to also take the putative shooting guard Tim Hardaway and his frightful contract. It was Steve Mills, the team president, whose feel for failure is bred in the bone, who handed Hardaway that $70.9 million deal two years ago. Now Mills and the rest of the Knicks’ vaunted leadership group have traded Porzingis to get rid of it.Had I been able to reach Mark Cuban, the Mavericks’ owner, for comment on his Porzingis heist, I can only assume he would have dissolved into uncontrollable laughter.We live in a national age of delusion and unapologetic rule-breaking, so perhaps there is a pleasingly nefarious explanation for this trade. If so, Knicks management should cling to it like a barnacle on the hull of a sinking ship. Perhaps the Knicks have successfully tampered with another team’s asset and know that Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving, or both, will sign in the summer now that the franchise has plenty of cap space.But I would put the chances that the Knicks could pull off something that clever and diabolical at 6.82 percent. When in doubt it is wisest to bank on inexplicable incompetence.Porzingis apparently helped set all this off by requesting a trade. As a 7-foot-3 23-year-old coming off a serious knee injury, he represented a conundrum for management. Do you commit this summer to a long-term contract of the sort that would tickle the tummy of Croesus? Let’s assume the Knicks’ crack medical and rehabilitation staff warned that his future looked iffy.If so, why wouldn’t Knicks management dangle Porzingis for a week or more to interested teams and let natural competitive instincts come into play around the league? When healthy, Porzingis is a top 20 player, and that made him a rare asset. Instead, the Knicks traded him posthaste for the aging center DeAndre Jordan and a talented, but raw, point guard, Dennis Smith Jr. The Knicks already have raw point guards, so maybe management succumbed to a collect-them-all fever.All theories and psychological analyses are welcome.I’ve followed the Knicks for decades now, and my sons soon contracted my affliction. Like residents in a smallpox ward we often debate whether we have divined one obscure reason or another for faint hope, which is why I hopped the subway a week ago and went to Barclays Center to watch the Knicks take on the Brooklyn Nets.It was a desultory affair at times, but it did feature a Nets team that is climbing in the standings with surprising speed, in contrast to the Knicks, who are hurtling happily downward. And the Nets played like men returned from a near-death experience, happily surprised to possess a winning record after four losing seasons in the Hades of the N.B.A.To his credit, the Nets’ general manager, Sean Marks, has executed a smart rebuild with a fishmonger’s eye for plucking useful talent out of the discard pool. The Nets play a swarming defense with a collective bounce, and their wait-who-is-that-guy no-names are long on desire and short on distorting egos. It was possible to daydream that if only they could sign a Durant or a Kawhi Leonard as a free agent, the Nets could be a genuine terror in the Eastern Conference.The Knicks offer terror of a different sort. They decided this season to double down on what they have done instinctually for so many years and devote their energies to pure losing. They are superb at it. Entering Friday’s game against Boston, their record stood at 10-40, which assures them a high draft pick in June.The modern N.B.A. is an upstairs-downstairs league and runs a two-tier competition: The upstairs version is staged by the top 10 or so teams and is all about winning and praying that your team will not face the Golden State Warriors until late in the playoffs, at which point you will be excused for exiting quickly and feet first.The downstairs version involves a half-dozen teams, and the point is to become the worst of the worst and pray you can draft a young stud who will turn around your franchise. The worst-run teams return year after year to this brackish well. This is the game at which the Knicks currently excel.And there is indeed much unlovely about these Knicks. Their defense occupies a netherworld between theoretical and clueless. Their now-traded shooting guard, Hardaway, appeared to have had his conscience surgically removed and would shoot anywhere at any time and none too successfully."
Basketball,"Filip Peraić was in a rut. A freelance illustrator bored of his contract work, he had hoped to reignite his love of art through a long-term personal project.It made sense that Peraić, 30, who is from the basketball-obsessed city of Zadar, Croatia, would come up with a project related to the N.B.A. But instead of taking a broad look at his favorite players, or honoring his country’s many N.B.A. stars, Peraić decided to do something more specific — remarkably so. His project would consist entirely of portraits of James Harden’s head in profile, from the right side of the Houston Rockets star’s face.Suddenly Harden, who is known for his distinctive beard, existed in portrait form — as a tribute to Jackson Pollock in one of Peraić’s works and as a tribute to Wassily Kandinsky in another. There was one in the style of a medical illustration, and another that was a map of the fictional country of Hardenia. His beard became a giant whale, and it took on the distinctive curls of a Greek philosopher. In one particularly disturbing image, Harden’s face was replicated with human hair. In all, Peraić’s project, which came to be known as James Harden Illustrated, had 26 images, each one seemingly more bizarre than the previous one.“The best portraits are when I surprise myself,” Peraić said in a telephone interview. “I’m thinking about James Harden’s head constantly — it’s my passion project.”With Harden in the middle of a remarkable season, in which he is almost certain to finish with the highest scoring average of any player in N.B.A. history besides Wilt Chamberlain and Michael Jordan, Peraić is set to release another batch of the illustrations. The first was posted Thursday, and there will be one released each week for the next seven weeks, thus carrying Peraić’s followers into the playoffs.On Tuesday, in hopes of showcasing the existing work in advance of the new batch, Peraić tweeted out a thread of the 26 original images, which were completed from 2013 to 2017. The thread caught fire and was shared and favorited thousands of times.Peraić said the attention the posts received was gratifying, but he was especially excited by certain people who noticed them.He referred to a few journalists who shared the post, then mentioned two people who favorited the thread: Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets, and Kirk Goldsberry, a former San Antonio Spurs executive. “That’s really cool because as an N.B.A. geek, I follow these people constantly,” Peraić said. “To see them reacting to my work is really rewarding.”Then there was Harden. He was once interviewed on TNT with a poster of Peraić’s portraits behind him. But other than that, Peraić did not know how Harden felt about the work. That changed Wednesday afternoon. Harden tweeted six of the images, reacting to each with emoji. “Yo @filiperaic,” Harden wrote in the first of the series of tweets, “these are dope!”Beyond rubbing elbows online with his N.B.A. heroes, Peraić has experienced tangible career benefits from the project. Recently, he worked on a series of images for the singer-songwriter Leon Bridges, and while the images may not have Harden’s beard in them, they are clearly in the same vein as the Harden project.The rut he had found himself in career-wise, it seemed, had created an opportunity.“I started this project just for my own pleasure and to try something else because I wasn’t satisfied with the kind of work I was getting,” Peraić said. “Now art directors come up to me and say, ‘We want this kind of James Harden portrait.’”Amusingly enough, considering how much time Peraić spends thinking about Harden, the Rockets guard is not, and has never been, the illustrator’s favorite player. He mentioned living near the city in Croatia where Drazen Petrovic, the Hall of Famer, grew up, and said he had always preferred Manu Ginobili and Kobe Bryant over Harden."
Basketball,"Amid all the breathless chatter these days about Zion Williamson and Duke being favored to win the N.C.A.A. Tournament, which begins next week, it is easy to forget that Villanova is the reigning champion and will remain so until — and only if — it is dethroned.“For everybody who doesn’t think that Villanova’s still one of the elite teams in the country — wait till they play them,” Providence Coach Ed Cooley said after his team lost to the Wildcats in the Big East tournament on Thursday.This has been a season of transition at Villanova, but in many ways it has been a lot like the last few that came before it. Despite having lost four players to the N.B.A. from last season’s N.C.A.A. title team — Villanova’s second championship in the past three years — the Wildcats won the Big East regular-season crown for the fifth time in six years. A win in this week’s conference tournament at Madison Square Garden would be their fourth in five years. Two Wildcats — guard Phil Booth and forward Eric Paschall — were unanimous selections to the all-Big East team this week, and a third starter — forward Saddiq Bey — made the all-freshman squad.Yet when experts list the top contenders to lift the N.C.A.A. championship trophy, they often start with Duke and its star freshmen, Williamson and R. J. Barrett; the Blue Devils’ Atlantic Coast Conference rivals Virginia and North Carolina; perpetually competitive Kentucky; and top-ranked Gonzaga. Those lists rarely run deep enough to include Villanova.“We see it all,” Coach Jay Wright said. “And we always tell them, if we’re not getting any attention right now, it’s fine. But we’re not thinking we’re not any good because of it.”Wright’s expectations for this season had to be adjusted even before it began. Entering last year’s N.C.A.A. Tournament, Wright expected to lose two of his best players, Mikal Bridges and Jalen Brunson, to the N.B.A. draft. But after the Wildcats beat Michigan in the final, two underclassmen — forward Omari Spellman and guard Donte DiVincenzo — decided to turn professional as well.Had Spellman and DiVincenzo returned, Villanova probably would have been favored to repeat as national champion. Even if only one had come back, Villanova would have been among the favorites. Instead, all four players were selected in the first 33 picks of the draft.That changed the calculus for Wright. In recent years, Villanova had built its success by redshirting players — last year’s roster featured seven, including Bridges, Spellman and DiVincenzo — who had taken a year to learn Wright’s system and the team’s methods without competing in games. But the departures of four key players in one off-season forced Wright to adapt on the fly.To compensate for a sudden lack of depth, Wright did something he rarely does: He added a graduate transfer, the former Albany guard Joe Cremo, who offered experience and scoring in the backcourt. And then he told Booth and Eric Paschall, two redshirt seniors, that he would expect more from them.The rebuilt Wildcats have struggled at times. Villanova has lost nine games this season after losing only four all of last year. It opened the season with a 27-point home loss to Michigan in a game that was billed as a national championship rematch, and it later endured two sets of back-to-back losses and a recent three-game losing streak.Still, Booth and Paschall have steadied the ship; they are now the Wildcats’ leading scorers.“I couldn’t be more proud of them,” Wright said, adding: “They had a really difficult task in our program this year with a lot of new guys. Not just leading them but being patient with them and teaching them.”Along with Booth and Paschall, Wright has had to rely heavily on the sophomore Collin Gillespie, who has seamlessly taken over the point guard duties once held by Brunson. “He’s a sophomore,” Wright said, “and we’re kind of treating him like a senior.”Regardless of what happens this weekend or over the next few weeks, though, Villanova’s future looks bright. Wright, 57, is one of two active Division I men’s coaches eligible this year for the basketball hall of fame, and he is widely expected to get in. And new talent is already on the way: The lure of two recent national titles has helped Wright lock up perhaps the country’s best recruiting class for 2019.Whether this Villanova team can match the success of its recent predecessors before those players arrive remains to be seen. The Wildcats beat fourth-seeded Xavier, 71-67, in overtime Friday night to advance to Saturday’s conference title game against Seton Hall, which defeated Marquette in the other semifinal."
Basketball,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Some of the most memorable scenes from the N.B.A.’s 68th All-Star Game played out away from the ball, both on and adjacent to the bench of the squad captained by LeBron James.Two very deep 3-pointers from Damian Lillard sparked a comeback from 20 points down that had some of the game’s biggest names bounding farther onto the floor in the celebration than the rules would ever allow in a game that counts. And in that same corner of Spectrum Center, another spectacle percolated: Anthony Davis, the disgruntled New Orleans Pelicans superstar, spending the entire second half as a rather forlorn spectator.Those close enough to see it simply couldn’t miss the contrast.Davis tested his freshly tweaked left shoulder in warm-ups, registered 5 points in five minutes and then opted for safety — and what passed for solitude — while a raucous rally unfolded around him. Led by Lillard and the All-Star M.V.P. Kevin Durant, Team LeBron climbed out of that huge hole to record a 178-164 victory over the team captained by Giannis Antetokounmpo. Yet it was a muted end to the league’s annual party weekend for the player whose future has generated more noise than anyone or anything in basketball since September. That’s when Davis hired the Klutch Sports agent Rich Paul — who is also James’s agent and one of the superstar’s closest friends — to precipitate a seemingly ceaseless stream of chatter about Davis winding up alongside James on the Los Angeles Lakers. That might still happen. Even though the league’s annual trade deadline has passed — and even with Davis revealing in a wild interview session Saturday that he is more open to being dealt to the Boston Celtics than had been previously described — no one is prepared to suggest that the Lakers are out of this trade chase.The firmest and smartest declaration to be made at this juncture is that Davis’s reverse layup and swished 3-pointer from the left wing Sunday night should be the last two shots he takes for the rest of the season. It is time for the Pelicans, league officials and Davis’s camp to collectively decide that the wisest move for all parties is to shelve The Brow for New Orleans’ 23 remaining games.Davis has every right, like countless All-Stars before him, to request a trade. The sport’s best have anointed James their muscle-flexing role model and are taking greater control of their futures than ever before. Why shouldn’t they if they have the juice?Once that happens, though, Davis’s team should be able to protect the franchise’s interests above anything else. New Orleans has not been granted that right.It emerged Jan. 28 that Davis, through Paul, informed the Pelicans that he would not be signing the five-year, $240 million contract extension they were planning to offer July 1, and that he wanted to be traded instead. New Orleans spent the ensuing 10 days before the trade deadline fielding offers for Davis — mostly from the overzealous Lakers — but did so knowing all along that the pool of worthy offers would be wider if they waited until June.When the deadline predictably passed on Feb. 7 with no deal, New Orleans was ordered by the N.B.A. to play Davis for the rest of the season — even though a precedent had already been set to give the team full control in similar cases involving Houston’s Carmelo Anthony and Memphis’ Chandler Parsons. Davis has played in four games since, routinely taking the proverbial air out of the Pelicans when he’s been on the court and, in his most recent appearance, injuring his shoulder.The Pelicans don’t want Davis in the lineup because of the gloom his ongoing presence spawns, but also to try to avoid a serious injury that could adversely affect his trade value. The N.B.A.’s position is that they differentiate between true game-changers like Davis and mortal players. It is my position that they absolutely should not."

Basketball,"LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo will have their work cut out for them when they make their picks as captains in just the second N.B.A. All-Star draft — and the first to be televised. The task is their prize for receiving the most votes in their conferences — James in the West, and Antetokounmpo in the East — during All-Star balloting from fans, media and players.To help them out, we stepped in as captains for a mock draft in our bid to build the perfect teams. We have asked Marc Stein, our venerable N.B.A. reporter and columnist, to weigh in on which of us came away with a winner.The rules are the same as those that will be employed on Thursday:Each team must first select a starting lineup from the eight other starters as selected by the fans, media and players. The second round will feature the 14 reserves, and the third round will feature the game’s two veteran ambassadors, Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks and Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat. Team LeBron (Scott Cacciola) will pick first in the first and third rounds, and Team Giannis (Benjamin Hoffman) will pick first among the reserves. Cacciola: If I’m channeling my Inner LeBron, I’m rewarding Harden for his ridiculous first half of the season by making him the first pick, and I’m going to expect him to take no fewer than 20 stepback 3s from just inside half-court.Hoffman: There are arguments to be made for other players, but once you consider Giannis’s skill set, there is no one more complementary than Curry. With the space created by Curry’s outside shooting — he’s actually gotten more bold with long 3-pointers, if you can believe it — the lane will be wide open for the dunks that will get Giannis named the game’s most valuable player.Cacciola: Wait a second, Ben: I didn’t know we were treating this like an actual game with actual strategy. That changes everything. Or does it? Putting aside personal rivalries, with my second pick, I’m taking Kevin Durant because he, too, is really good at basketball. I also want to reunite him with Harden, his former teammate, and let them fight over the ball.Hoffman: I’m not loving the size disparity so far — Harden is officially only three inches taller than Curry but is also somehow at least two feet taller than Curry — so I’ll take the biggest guy in the starter pool. But based on my stated goal of designing a team to get Giannis the M.V.P. Award, I would be careful about having these two on the floor together all that much unless we start to fall behind.Cacciola: I need a defensive stopper. While I acknowledge that a case could be made for Paul George as the league’s top defender this season, is there any question that Leonard will approach this game the same way he does a mid-March clash with the Bucks? The guy does not turn off the intensity — ever. So I’m having him guard all five guys at once, because I already know that no one else will even pretend to play defense.Hoffman: There’s a legitimate argument that you have the best four players on the court so far, and despite my belief that my guys are perfect to play with each other, I’m getting a little nervous. The obvious play here would be to counter the Kawhi pick with George, but I want to avoid the LeBron-Kyrie pairing because I’ve seen how dangerous it can be.Cacciola: I’m going with more size and more versatility with my final pick among the starters, and I think you’re in trouble, Ben. A quick aside: George has been incredible for the Thunder this season, and he looks like a man playing with an untroubled conscience — and without the distraction of free agency and looming future decisions. If you take a look at this current batch of All-Stars, that makes George something of a rare breed.Hoffman: O.K., so I didn’t actually have a choice to make here, but if there’s going to be one guy left in a gym waiting to be picked, it’s pretty good for it to be a guy who had a 60-point game earlier this season and who happens to be playing in his home arena. My team is small and fast so far, but over all there’s a star-power gap that I’m going to have to make up for in the reserves, which I will do from the start by stealing Anthony Davis (before Actual LeBron steals him from the Actual Pelicans).Team LeBron: James Harden, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George"
Basketball,"Mr. Mueller did not suggest additional charges as part of his investigation, when he delivered his findings to Mr. Barr on Friday. This caps the special counsel’s charges at 199, filed against 34 people and three companies.The “principal conclusions” of the special counsel investigation, which Mr. Barr said he might be able to share with lawmakers in the coming days, are not likely to include many details. In a letter to lawmakers, Mr. Barr said he would consult with Mr. Mueller and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, about what other information from the report can be released.Mr. Mueller’s report could be brief or several hundred pages. It is now up to Mr. Barr to decide how much of it to share with Congress, and when.The late Friday afternoon news dump in Washington is typically reserved space by those wishing to bury bad news. In the case of Mr. Mueller’s report, bad news is most assuredly in the eye of the beholder. In a brief interview, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was circumspect about what comes next. “We are confident the attorney general will make the right decision,” he said. “He has to consider the legal matters and rules. I’m confident he’ll make the right call. He’s a very good lawyer — a fine lawyer. We’re very comfortable with any decision.”Mr. Giuliani said that he planned to remain in Washington over the weekend, in part because Mr. Barr said he may update Congress on Mr. Mueller’s findings soon.[Maggie Haberman, Michael Schmidt, Mark Mazzetti and more of our journalists explained what the submission of the full report means and what may come next.]Shortly after the report was delivered, Jay Sekulow and Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers, offered a brief statement:The Mueller investigation was closed without Mr. Trump ever sitting for a formal interview. The president’s lawyers were fearful of what he might say under penalty of perjury, and did not want him to sit for one. They anticipated that Mr. Mueller would not engage in a protracted battle to try to subpoena the president, and Mr. Mueller never did. The investigators did receive written answers to questions.Among those traveling with Mr. Trump to Florida aboard Air Force One on Friday was the new White House counsel, Pat Cipollone. The counsel’s office anticipates reviewing the report for possible issues related to executive privilege.With the delivery of the report looming, in Florida, at the president’s Mar-a-Lago resort, Mr. Trump and his top aides stuck to business as usual: meeting with five Caribbean leaders, placing a phone call to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, and, of course, tweeting.But a sense of anxiety loomed, and Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts added to the confusion on a day in which everyone around Mr. Trump was bracing for the end of the Russia investigation and what it might mean for his presidency. A confusing tweet by Mr. Trump at 1:22 p.m. seemed to roll back sanctions on North Korea, undermining his Treasury secretary, although later in the day, officials tried to clarify that Mr. Trump was talking about sanctions that were under consideration but not yet announced.Aides were waiting to see what language Mr. Mueller’s team used in the report about the president’s actions before pushing ahead with a more vocal response.Mr. Trump has said that the report should be made public. But lawmakers are not relying on him. In a joint statement, the two top Democrats in Congress, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer said that “it is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress. Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any ‘sneak preview’ of Special Counsel Mueller’s findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public.”"
Basketball,"The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau chief. Sign up to get it by email.___Parliament approved a bill this week to allow medical evacuation for asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus over the opposition of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, throwing Australia into another visceral debate over immigration.In the coming months, with an election approaching, we can expect to hear all kinds of intense and moralistic rhetoric.Mr. Morrison and his supporters are already arguing that opening the door even a little to settlement in Australia will encourage a flood of migrants and deaths at sea. Labor, the Greens and others on the left are maintaining that immigration is a net positive for Australia and that cruelty must be restrained.This is all part of a broader conversation across the West about migration and national identity; the White House announced just today that President Trump will declare a state of emergency to build a border wall.And it’s a conversation that matters. These disputes, however they end up, will shape many countries, and the world, for decades.But for me, there’s a certain familiarity to the discussion, not just in Washington but also in Canberra.I’ve written about immigration for nearly 20 years, from various countries, from the neighborhoods and towns where immigrants cluster to the halls of power where decisions are made.Along the way, there are a few things I’ve learned to look out for.The Hero Vs. Villain TrapIn heated moments like this one, immigrants and the nuances of their lives and motivations tend to be reduced to the most simplistic of archetypes.Either they are criminals (the worst of the worst, rapists, murders, pedophiles) or they are blameless hard-working heroes (say, doctors or professional basketball players from Australia in the N.B.A.).The reality — and this should be obvious, but often gets overlooked — is that most migrants are in the messy middle with the rest of us. They’re good and bad, they’re parents and workers, and they’re mostly just trying to make life a little bit better for themselves and their loved ones.This idea that they are somehow different and more extreme reflects little more than the political need for narrative and division. Beware of the packaging of simplicity."
Basketball,"Some level of bafflement attends tax-filing season every year. But in 2019, as Americans examine their returns for the first time under the full effect of the sweeping new Republican tax law, the situation is the most cryptic in memory. Some tax breaks have been erased or capped, while others have been expanded or introduced.This is equal-opportunity anxiety. Blue-state professionals feel micro-targeted by new limits on state and local tax deductions, while filers elsewhere can’t figure out why they’re no longer getting a fat refund, if the law was supposed to be so good for them.We asked accountants across the country to tell us their clients’ most common queries. Here are some answers.For many people living in high-tax states like New York, California, New Jersey and Connecticut, there’s one overriding reason their tax bills have risen: Their state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, will be capped at $10,000. This includes state and local income taxes, as well as real estate taxes.“Prior to 2018, SALT was often most New Yorkers’ largest itemized deduction,” said Tina Salandra, a certified public accountant in New York.New York City residents, for example, often have state and city taxes that total nearly 10 percent of their income, she added. So if your state and local taxes already exceed the $10,000 limit, you lose the ability to deduct any of your property taxes.As a result, some families may find that instead of itemizing, it’s better to take the larger standard deduction. “But even if you can still itemize, your total deductions will be limited regardless,” said Ms. Salandra, “which may likely result in higher taxes.”Her property-owning clients with incomes in the $200,000 to $400,000 range are feeling the most significant pinch. Though their tax rates have decreased, that usually does not make up for the loss of their largest itemized deductions.In early 2018, the I.R.S. took its best shot at offering guidance to employers about how to change tax withholding from paychecks. In general, it suggested decreases, since the 2017 law was supposed to be a cut. That should have resulted in bigger paychecks for most people.But if you were an employee receiving those checks, you may not have noticed the increase. If that was the case, you won’t be seeing the usual April refund: You’ve already gotten it, just parceled out into slightly higher 2018 paychecks.Want to get a refund next year? If that’s your goal, Julie A. Welch, a Leawood, Kan., accountant, suggests using the I.R.S. withholding calculator to adjust your paycheck. Most people never bother.Before breaking down what’s changed, let’s back up and explain the basics: Taxpayers are entitled to take a standard tax deduction amount, or they can itemize their deductions individually; they can deduct whichever amount is higher, resulting in a lower tax bill.Under the new tax law, the standard deduction has doubled (to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for joint filers), while several itemized deductions have been eliminated or limited. TurboTax estimates that as a result, nearly 90 percent of taxpayers will now take the standard deduction, up from about 70 percent in previous years. To help you figure out the best choice, the company has posted a three-step interactive tool on its blog.It depends, said Tyler Mickey, a tax senior manager at Moss Adams in Wenatchee, Wash.Under the previous law, spouses paying alimony could deduct those payments on their returns, while the recipients had to include the income on theirs. That remains the case for divorce agreements finalized on or before Dec. 31, 2018 (unless a couple changes the agreement after then). Therefore it’s true for returns filed this year."
Basketball,"BEIJING — To most Americans, the names are unfamiliar, maybe a little hard to pronounce: Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo.They are China’s biggest smartphone brands. Around the world — although not in the United States — they are making the handset business brutally competitive. This week, after Apple warned of disappointing iPhone sales in China, industry observers said that devices from the Chinese brands were a major culprit.As the phone market in China reaches saturation and sales shrink over all, the country’s hardware makers are pushing hard, and increasingly winning fans, in places like France, Germany, India and Southeast Asia, where consumers find that the phones can do just about everything an iPhone can do at a fraction of the cost.Apple sits comfortably atop the market in many countries, including China, for the highest-end handsets. But companies like Huawei have started to do elsewhere what they have done in China, competing with the iPhone on experience and value and luring customers with price comparisons that make them rethink buying Apple’s signature product.The cost difference is notable: In China, an iPhone XR starts at around $950, while Huawei’s top-end handsets start at about $600, and Xiaomi’s comparable models start at even less. The iPhone XS starts at around $1,250.Companies like Huawei and Oppo have made improvements in features and overall quality that are enticing many wealthy Chinese people, said Mo Jia, an analyst in Shanghai for the technology research firm Canalys. Chinese brands’ aggressive marketing and sales campaigns in Europe indicate that the companies believe consumers there who have traditionally used iPhones will do the same thing.“Maybe it won’t happen this year or next year,” Mr. Jia said. “But Huawei is going in that direction.”In its pursuit of the European market, Huawei (pronounced “HWA-way”), which has its headquarters in Shenzhen and is now the world’s No. 2 seller of smartphones, has gone far beyond the phone store. Huawei has sponsored summer concerts in Greece, teamed up with Lithuania’s basketball federation and backed a “China Festival” in Cologne, Germany. Vivo sponsored last year’s World Cup in Russia.Xiaomi (pronounced “SHAO-mee”), which is based in Beijing and was founded in 2010, seemingly came out of nowhere to become the No. 4 mobile brand in Europe early last year, according to Canalys. The gadget maker has also become the top seller of phones in India, in part by opening hundreds of stores in rural areas.Clément Blaise, a 25-year-old banker in northern France, has an iPhone for work and a Xiaomi as a personal phone. He said he needed to recharge the Apple device “all the time” but could go two days without charging his Xiaomi.“We have this false, preconceived idea that Chinese brands are not as good, that their products are of cheap quality,” Mr. Blaise said. “But the price gap leavens the fears. For 150 euros” — around $170 — “what do you risk anyway?”Chinese phone makers have not made similar inroads in the United States. The American government has worked for years to stymie the sale of Huawei’s smartphones and telecom-network equipment, after a congressional inquiry in 2012 deemed Huawei a potential vehicle for cyberspying by the Chinese government. The Trump administration has urged Western allies to do the same.Security concerns have not dissuaded some buyers across the Atlantic. Giannis Vassilopoulos, a college student in Athens, said he had been bombarded by Huawei ads during his recent travels around Europe. He said he had bought a Huawei phone because the brand felt more familiar, more European even.“Seeing Huawei in the middle of London makes it look immediately more Western,” he said.Apple still has a hold on consumers in many places. Announcing the sales slump in China this week, the company’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said Apple expected to set revenue records in wealthier countries like Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, South Korea and Spain and in some emerging markets like Malaysia, Mexico, Poland and Vietnam."
Basketball,"The fate of the soaring, palatial and utterly impractical Dime Savings Bank in Downtown Brooklyn was inevitable.The 16,750-square-foot, 40-foot-tall chamber, with seven kinds of marble flooring, a vaulted-tile dome and Corinthian columns, closed in 2016, a victim of automated tellers and digital payments. Its last full-time tenant, Chase Bank, moved into a squat storefront across the street, about one-tenth the size.The bank’s second act is more surprising: It will become part of Brooklyn’s tallest skyscraper, 9 DeKalb, a 1,066-foot luxury apartment building with retail at its base. The landmark Beaux-Arts interior will be transformed into a flagship store, and the roof will become an outdoor lounge with a pool that wraps around an ornate Guastavino dome. The marble and pink granite facade will be fused on one side to a slender glass-and-steel tower designed by SHoP Architects, which will have about 425 rentals and 150 condo apartments.Across the city, a number of old banks are similarly gaining new currency, as developers search for prime sites at a time of near-record land prices. In the past, the scale of these conversions was often smaller — perhaps a handful of apartments above a bank hall, or a drugstore with incongruously ornate chandeliers. Now, thanks in part to residential demand in quickly gentrifying areas, the projects are becoming more ambitious.“The market continues to be hungry for development opportunities, and these represent niche plays,” said Jonathan J. Miller, a New York real estate appraiser, who added that he noticed a similar trend near the peak of the 2007 housing bubble. There is the same glut of supply now, and developers are hoping the prestige of these buildings will pay dividends.Historic banks in New York are rare. There are roughly 81 landmark banks in the city, said Sarah Carroll, the chair of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. That designation requires developers who want to alter the facades — and in the case of 13 banks, the landmark interiors — to receive permission. While the commission does not track the current use of these buildings, most of those designated as landmarks are in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Many other historic bank buildings don’t have protected status, and their original reason for being no longer exists.“The issue is really analogous to churches — opulent spaces that were built for what was then a very widespread need,” said William Higgins, a principal at Higgins Quasebarth & Partners, a preservation firm that has consulted on a number of bank conversions. “That need recedes, and what’s left on the shore are these spectacular buildings that have lost their purpose.”In Chelsea, the 1897 New York Savings Bank became a carpet store in the late 1980s, a gourmet grocer in the mid-2000s, and is now a very stately CVS pharmacy. The 1906 Williamsburg Trust Company, an imposing temple to commerce at the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge, became a Ukrainian Orthodox Church in the 1960s. Until last year, the former Corn Exchange Bank on 42nd Street housed Show World Center, an adult-entertainment relic from the old Times Square. Now it is becoming offices.But there is value beyond a bank’s bricks and mortar: the air space above it. Most of the grand bank halls in the city were built before changes to zoning that allowed for greater height and density. By buying the unused development rights, or air rights, above a bank, a developer may build bigger, taller or both on an adjacent lot. That the banks are often in commuter-friendly business hubs also makes them appealing for redevelopment.In South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, a 23-story tower is rising beside the landmark 1908 Dime Savings Bank. The developers, Tavros Development and Charney Construction & Development, bought the adjacent lot as well as the bank’s air rights for $80 million, in 2016. The purchase allowed the developers to add 20,000 square feet of floor space to the new tower, making it one of the tallest in the neighborhood. There will be retail and office space on the lower floors, topped by 177 rental apartments, 30 percent rented below market rate. The tower, called the Dime, is expected to open in late 2019.In 2017, the developers convinced the branch owner to sell the neo-Classical bank hall outright for $12.3 million, allowing them to incorporate the building into their design. The 40-foot-tall interior space, with mullioned windows and decorative columns, will either become an office or retail space, a beer garden or restaurant. (Only the facade has landmark protection.) The roof will become part of an outdoor amenity for residents and office workers, with views of the Williamsburg Bridge. Amenities in the adjoining tower will include an indoor basketball court, yoga room and outdoor “misting stations” to cool down sunbathers.“When you’re viewed as the big, bad developer, how do you get the authenticity that people moving into neighborhoods like this crave?” asked Sam Charney, the principal of Charney Construction & Development. Monumental architecture isn’t a bad start. Being a block from the JMZ subway lines also helps.Those perks will be vital to the marketing pitch. About 80 percent of the units will be studios or one-bedrooms, with the average one-bedroom measuring about 560 square feet, said Nicholas Silvers, a partner at Tavros. The average size of one-bedroom rentals in the borough was 727 square feet in March, said Mr. Miller, the real estate appraiser.Prices haven’t been announced, but the developers’ strategy is to market units for less than those of nearby competitors, like 325 Kent, part of the redesigned Domino Sugar Refinery site, where the luxury rentals list for an average of $3,436 a month for one-bedroom apartments, according to StreetEasy.

Basketball,"Watching is The New York Times’s TV and film recommendation website. Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter here.Until we get the updated weather report from Punxsutawney Phil, it might remain best to stay inside, stay warm and stream. Below are the most interesting of what we’ve found among the new TV series and movies coming to the major streaming services in February, followed by a roundup of all the best new titles in all genres. (Streaming services occasionally change schedules without giving notice.)‘Generation Wealth’Starts streaming: Feb. 1, on Amazon.It can be hard to tell whether the current obsession with the lifestyles of the rich and famous — now often referred to as Kardashian Syndrome — is old hat, or a sign of something seriously wrong with our society. The photographer and filmmaker Lauren Greenfield investigates modern celebrity worship and the rampant consumerism that feeds into it by talking to bond traders, porn stars, child beauty pageant queens and the writer Bret Easton Ellis. Her film is most insightful, though, when she turns the camera on herself and her family and takes stock of their own values and aspirations. Could they be heading in the same sad direction as her other subjects?—‘Russian Doll’ Starts streaming: Feb. 1, on Netflix.The many-layered “Russian Doll” is a sort of downtown “Groundhog Day” — Nadia (Natasha Lyonne), a video game programmer, dies on the night of her 36th birthday party in the East Village, then wakes up to relive the same night and the same party all over again. And again. And again … Did she take a bad drug? Is she losing her mind? Or is something more existential in play? Lyonne, who created the show with Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland, is a revelation in this cleverly constructed, nearly perfect character study. —‘Velvet Buzzsaw’ Starts streaming: Feb. 1, on Netflix.This supernatural satire takes us inside a pompous art scene in which the latest buzz surrounds the disturbing work of a recently deceased painter. The artist’s last wish was that all of his work be destroyed, but (spoiler alert) that doesn’t happen. Unpleasant, demonic occurrences unfold for anyone attempting to make a profit off the art, including a smug critic played by Jake Gyllenhaal. The writer-director Dan Gilroy (“Nightcrawler”) finds plenty to laugh about even among the carnage. —‘Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot’Starts streaming: Feb. 8, on Amazon.John Callahan (Joaquin Phoenix) became a heavy drinker at the age of 12 and, after a car accident, a quadriplegic at 21. Despite his troubled beginnings, Callahan went on to become a noted cartoonist who managed to find caustic humor in the subject of disability. In “Don’t Worry,” based on Callahan’s memoir, the director Gus Van Sant also finds biting wit and brings an airy sweetness to this offbeat tale. The supporting cast, including Jonah Hill, Jack Black and Carrie Brownstein, is excellent. But this is Phoenix’s movie: He creates a portrait of a man who must learn how to bear this seemingly unbearable direction his life has suddenly taken and do so while making others laugh.—‘High Flying Bird’Starts streaming: Feb. 8, on Netflix.In this intimate, complex basketball drama from Steven Soderbergh, Ray (André Holland) is a top sports agent strategizing to get his players paid during an NBA lockout — which means deftly navigating a maze of contract negotiations, power structures and racial dynamics before the clock runs out. Soderbergh shot “High Flying Bird” on an iPhone (as he did with his previous feature “Unsane”), reportedly in just two weeks. But this doesn’t feel like a rush job: Instead, Tarell Alvin McCraney’s (“Moonlight”) tight, subversive script feels urgent and thrilling even though most of the action takes place on the sidelines or in offices, not on the court. —‘PEN15’ Starts streaming: Feb. 8, on Hulu.Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle are fully grown adults, but in this coming-of-age comedy series co-produced by The Lonely Island, the actresses play versions of their 13-year-old selves in seventh grade. (All of their middle-school classmates are played by actual 13-year-olds. Wisely, when one of their characters has her first kiss, an adult’s lips stand in for the teenage actor’s in close up, minimizing the ick factor.) The series is as strange as it sounds, and maybe a little strained; but it mostly works because Erskine and Konkle are not that tall and slouch a lot. “Pen15” shows there’s fun to be had in mining the cognitive dissonance of grown-ups inserted into adolescent situations.—"
Basketball,"Good Monday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)The digital pin board company disclosed today that its I.P.O. would value it at less than its last private fund-raising round. That’s a big warning sign for other tech companies that are poised to go public this year.The high range of Pinterest’s I.P.O. would value it at $11.3 billion, below the $12 billion attained from private investors two years ago. In Silicon Valley speak, that’s a “down round” — something companies generally hope to avoid because it undermines confidence.Coupled with early volatility in Lyft’s first days of trading, the Pinterest offering suggests that public market investors are wary of maintaining high valuations for tech start-ups, especially given that many won’t turn a profit for years.It comes as a slew of unicorns are preparing to go public, including Uber (whose I.P.O. was expected to give a valuation as high as $120 billion), the workplace messaging platform Slack and the software company PagerDuty.But there’s some reason not to panic yet. After initially falling below their I.P.O. price, Lyft shares bounced back. Other companies have gone on to do well after down rounds: For instance, the file-sharing company Box is trading well above its debut price two years after its I.P.O. And Pinterest could end up pricing its offering higher if investor demand proves robust during its road show.More I.P.O. news: Though many investors are betting against Lyft’s newly public stock, the high-profile short seller Andrew Left isn’t among them. The Bridgewater Associates founder argued last week that capitalism “needs to be reformed.” Now he has outlined how he would do it:Declare the wealth and opportunity gaps a national emergency. “I have a principle that you will not effect change unless you affect the people who have their hands on the levers of power so that they move them to change things the way you want them to change,” he writes.Devise clear metrics for success. “I’d bring that sort of accountability down to the individual level to encourage an accountability culture in which individuals are aware of whether they are net contributors or net detractors to the society, and the individuals and the society make attempts to make them net contributors.”Redistribute resources to eliminate disparities. Mr. Dalio’s personal recommendations include:• Creating private-public partnerships that would vet and invest in projects that produce both social and economic returns.• Raise taxes on pollution and other causes of bad health.• Impose targeted tax increases on the wealthiest to pay for social welfare programs to bolster economic productivity.Better coordinate monetary and fiscal policies, so that more money ends up in the hands of people who will spend it (the lower and middle classes) as opposed to saving it (the wealthy)."
Basketball,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]A long-limbed man carrying a black bag moved with purpose through the morning bustle of Flushing, Queens. He walked into the hush of the Chun Fook funeral home and down the marble steps to where the paperwork of death is handled.An employee in black led him into the privacy provided by a wooden screen. On a table draped with a gold cloth sat a small white box, and behind it, a framed portrait of the man’s sister and only sibling, Song Yang.In late November 2017, she either jumped or fell from a fourth-floor window as the police were banging on her door to arrest her, once again, for prostitution. She landed hard on 40th Road, a truncated street known for restaurants, illegal massage parlors and women on its sidewalks calling out “Massage? Massage?”Song Yang was 38.Her brother and mother, Song Hai and Shi Yumei, rushed from their remote home in northeastern China to unfamiliar Flushing, where they spent the next 15 months. Distrustful of the police account, Mr. Song, 36, began his own investigation into her death, distributing information-wanted posters, swapping tips with reporters and interrogating his sister’s sex-work colleagues.He became convinced that the police had thrown his sister from the window, and that the authorities were engaged in a cover-up. It did not matter that surveillance video demonstrated otherwise, or that an inquiry by the Queens district attorney’s office found no evidence of police misconduct. Bitter suspicion infused his grief.But Mr. Song’s investigation had stalled. Money had run out. Visas had expired. And a wife and 5-year-old son were waiting. It was time to return to China.Time to bring his sister home.The funeral home employee, Kevin Liu, opened the box. He explained to Mr. Song that the certificate of cremation — needed for customs — was inside, along with a sealed bag containing Song Yang’s ashes.Mr. Song raised the delicate matter of payment for more than a year’s rental of storage space — about $600. But the funeral home was well aware of the family’s woes. Whenever the brother and mother visited Song Yang’s remains, the mother was known to weep without pause.Mr. Liu settled on $200. Then, at Mr. Song’s request, he wrapped the box in a cloth of red, the color meant to convey wishes for safe passage of the soul.Mr. Song removed a black backpack from his bag, and the two men carefully placed the box and the portrait inside. Mr. Liu helped to strap the bag to Mr. Song’s back, shook his hand, and said, “Yilu shunfeng.”Have a safe journey.We spent most of 2018 following the Flushing travails of Mr. Song and Ms. Shi, as they inhabited the absence of their loved one, Song Yang. Then, in October, The New York Times published “The Case of Jane Doe Ponytail,” our lengthy account of her death and its aftermath."
Basketball,"WILLIAMS, Calif. — It’s time to add another name to the farewell tour circuit in this year of Elton John, Joan Baez, Paul Simon and Ozzy Osbourne: Edmund G. Brown Jr., the governor of California.There was the invitation-only reception for 2,000 guests at a Sacramento basketball arena; the appearance on “Meet the Press” this past Sunday to talk about President Trump and offer dark warnings about global warming; the sold-out Sacramento Press Club forum and the interviews with The Los Angeles Times, The Sacramento Bee and many others. On a recent Saturday alone, as Mr. Brown and his wife, Anne Gust Brown, shivered in front of a fire in their new home at the family ranch here in Williams, there were five separate interview and photography sessions.Not that anyone should consider this any kind of long goodbye for Mr. Brown, whose successor will be sworn in on Monday.“No, we’ve got a lot to do,” Mr. Brown said. “I’ve been doing pardons. We have regulations we have been putting out. Appointments. So there’s a lot — the activity has continued apace.”Mr. Brown, who served as California’s 34th governor and its 39th, has long counseled against overexposure. But he is someone who enjoys the limelight as much as the next politician — and understands as well as anyone that his window is closing. Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor, is moving into the governor’s office in the Capitol next week, and Mr. Brown is riding a wave of attention that will disappear as surely as his state trooper escort.Mr. Brown is making the most of it. He is using his remaining days to offer warnings about the future of California and the planet and lessons learned from a half-century in public life, and to talk about a legacy of fiscal restraint — he arrived eight years ago to a $26 billion deficit, and is leaving a $14 billion surplus — and opposition to Mr. Trump. He also delivered some not-so-veiled admonitions for his successor about a recession that he suggested had already started, and a looming assertion of power by interest groups and newly liberated Democratic lawmakers enjoying near historic margins in the Legislature.“The Democratic constituencies want more money and more laws,” Mr. Brown said. “I take a different view. We have too many damn laws. The coercive power of the state should be invoked sparingly. They tell me almost all of the bills that I have vetoed have been reintroduced.”Does he expect Mr. Newsom to approach the job in a similarly prescriptive way? “You know what a governor is on an engine?” Mr. Brown said. “The governor prevents the engine from getting out of control. Well, that is what the governor has to do in state government.”Mr. Newsom, in interviews, has pledged to increase spending on early childhood education and a few other programs, but nonetheless said he would continue the fiscal practices followed by the departing governor.This is not a moment of transition only for Mr. Brown; it is one for California, as well. The Brown family has been an integral part of political life here since Pat Brown, Mr. Brown’s father, was elected governor in 1958. Jerry Brown has served as governor twice, as mayor of Oakland, as state Democratic Party chairman and as attorney general. His sister Kathleen served as state treasurer.But Mr. Brown, 80, who married for the first time in 2005, never had children. There is no one left to carry the family legacy. He is stepping down because of term limits; he said in an interview he probably would not have run again even if there was no term limit statute, if only because history has not looked kindly on governors of big states who seek third terms.Not that he wasn’t tempted.“What will I not miss?” Mr. Brown said, parrying a question with a question as he spoke at a luncheon. “I like it all. I like fund-raising. I like sparring with the press. I like attacking my opponents. I like being attacked. I like the whole thing. People in this business like attention and you get a lot of attention as governor.”A few days later at the ranch, Mr. Brown said he did not know whether he would attend Mr. Newsom’s inauguration. “These are vulgar details,” he said. “I have a whole staff in charge of details. I’m more about the large, larger questions that are affecting our times.” (Short answer from one of those staff members: Of course he is.)Mr. Brown declined in an interview to offer Mr. Newsom advice — that, he said, would be unseemly — though he arched his eyebrows when asked if Mr. Newsom had sought his counsel during this two-month transition."
Basketball,"In Las Vegas, hotel room rates seem to shift like rolling dice. Sometimes you win and get a $199 rate in March at the Bellagio resort, and sometimes —including over St. Patrick’s Day weekend (this year from March 15 to 17) — you’ll pay $429.Traffic in Las Vegas spikes over holidays like Chinese New Year, and events like the N.C.A.A. March Madness basketball tournament (March 19 to April 8). Add in 22,000 annual meetings that may draw as many as 175,000 attendees to a town with 150,000 hotel rooms, and you have a case study in travel economics: With crowds come higher prices. Conversely, fewer people often means lower prices. “If you’re flexible with your dates, you can get so much more bang for your buck,” said Yves Marceau, the vice president of product at G Adventures, a tour company where spring itineraries to Europe, for example, can save 20 percent or more over summer trips.Rather than strictly traveling in the off-season, when savings can be greatest but weather is often at its worst, the trick is to find soft periods in times of stronger demand. Cheaper travel varies widely by destination, but there are a few general guidelines to follow while planning. In addition to checking convention traffic (Las Vegas lists its meetings at vegasmeansbusiness.com), look for holidays in a foreign destination and probe airline booking calendars for soft travel days. Search engines like Kayak indicate “good days to travel,” meaning bargain days, and the airfare prediction app Hopper shows a calendar color-coded to pricing.While not comprehensive, the following month-by-month list provides information on deals in popular global destinations, and a few cautionary flags.Spring is the time to head to Europe for culture without the crowds. Airfare is about 20 percent cheaper in March, April and May, versus June, July and August, according to Hopper. Those savings in 2018 ran between $160 and $210 a ticket.Among beach destinations, try Bali the last three weeks of March after Nyepi (the Day of Silence), which takes place March 7. “Bali is one of those places that’s pretty constant temperature wise because it’s near the equator,” said Sandy Staples, the president of Artistico Travel Consultants, a Folsom, Calif.-based travel agency in the Virtuoso network. “In March, some of the hotels are 50 percent off what they are in July and August.”Spring in Alaska offers early wildlife-watching opportunities as animals emerge from hibernation and whales return. This year, two small-ship cruise lines, UnCruise and Alaskan Dream Cruises, are introducing new sailings that start as early as April and highlight the season of gushing waterfalls. UnCruise begins its itineraries on April 6 with a seven-night sailing between Juneau and Sitka starting at $2,995 a person. In July, a similar sailing starts at $4,495.Tip: In Latin America and Christian religious sites like Rome, Semana Santa, or Holy Week, can clog not just the week of Easter but the week prior, and you can expect higher prices.Orlando receives 72 million visitors throughout the year. High season coincides with school breaks, including spring break, summer vacation and the winter holidays. But the window after spring break in late April until Memorial Day, there’s a slight dip. Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge, for example, has rooms at 25 percent off during this period (it also has a similar sale for summer if booked by March 24). A recent search on Travelocity showed weekend rates at the Hilton Orlando at $146 in May versus $221 a month later.Tip: Japan during Golden Week, generally the first week of May (April 29 through May 6), is a vacation period that is expected to be particularly busy this year as a new emperor takes the throne.Normally pricey, Aspen, Colo., is a relative steal in early June, when the mountains are green again, and occupancy is at 57 percent. The Limelight Aspen hotel has rooms from $225, versus over $400 in summer. Visit before the annual Food & Wine Classic in Aspen, which takes place in mid-June, and the Aspen Ideas Festival, June 20 to 29. In the Caribbean, the hurricane season runs June 1 to Nov. 30, with the heaviest storm activity historically taking place in September, according to the National Hurricane Center. If you can handle the heat, the calm of early summer brings both deals and good visibility for snorkeling and diving. June and November are both relatively inexpensive. A recent check at Montpelier Plantation & Beach on Nevis found rooms in June at $235 versus $675 in February.In the United States, the July 4 holiday is a busy time to travel and a lousy time to look for deals. But just on the other side of it, there’s a relative lull in a few unexpected places, including Lake Tahoe, Calif. Over the July 4th week, rates at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Lake Tahoe, according to a recent search, were running from $272, and drop $30 a night the week after.In Costa Rica, you will likely see some rain in the afternoons during the May-to-November “green season,” but the forests will be lush. Dantica Cloud Forest Lodge in San Gerardo de Dota near Los Quetzales National Park has rates in green season from $159, versus $184 in high season."
Basketball,"When the United States government wants to raise money from individuals, its mode of choice, for more than a century, has been to tax what people earn — the income they receive from work or investments.But what if instead the government taxed the wealth you had accumulated?That is the idea behind a policy Senator Elizabeth Warren has embraced in her presidential campaign. It represents a more substantial rethinking of the federal government’s approach to taxation than anything a major presidential candidate has proposed in recent memory — a new wealth tax that would have enormous implications for inequality.It would shift more of the burden of paying for government toward the families that have accumulated fortunes in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. And over time, such a tax would make it less likely that such fortunes develop.It would create big new challenges for the I.R.S. in ensuring compliance. There is a reason many European countries that once had a wealth tax have abandoned it in the last couple of decades.And that’s before you get to the legal and political challenges. There is an open debate around whether a wealth tax is constitutional. And some of the most powerful families in the country would certainly deploy their vast resources against a wealth tax, and against any candidate who embraces it.The comedian Chris Rock had a routine in the early 2000s in which he expounded on the distinction between those who are rich and those who are wealthy.Shaquille O’Neal, the star basketball player, was rich, Mr. Rock said. The team owner who signed his paycheck was wealthy. And that, in a nutshell, gets at the conceptual difference between trying to tax people’s income, as the tax code does today, versus their wealth.The C.E.O. of Walmart makes about $22 million a year. He is rich by any definition. But the Walton family, descendants of the company’s founder, are mind-bogglingly wealthy. The Bloomberg Billionaires index estimates that Sam Walton’s three living children are worth around $45 billion each, putting them each among the 20 wealthiest people in the world.A family that has accumulated enormous wealth can escape with surprisingly low income levels, and therefore tax burdens.In an extreme example, Warren Buffett owns enough stock in Berkshire Hathaway to put his estimated net worth at $84 billion, but he pays himself $100,000 a year to be its chief executive. Even in years when his wealth rises by billions, he must pay tax only on his comparatively modest income and on the gains from shares that he chooses to sell.Ms. Warren and other advocates of a wealth tax argue that this accumulation of untaxed or lightly taxed wealth is a bad thing. They say that it enables the creation of democracy-distorting dynasties who accumulate political power, and that tax policy should be used to rein them in more than the current tax code does.Developed by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two University of California, Berkeley, economists who are leading scholars of inequality, the proposal is to tax a family’s wealth above $50 million at 2 percent a year, with an additional surcharge of 1 percent on wealth over $1 billion.Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman estimate that 75,000 households would owe such a tax, or about one out of 1,700 American families.A family worth $60 million would owe the federal government $200,000 in wealth tax, over and above what they may owe on income from wages, dividends or interest payments."
Basketball,"When I was younger, I wanted to be like Khadijah James when I grew up. She had a really “black”-sounding name like mine, ran her own magazine business, was not too girlie, remained down for the people, achieved what she wanted, was loyal to her friends and had a fine man. She was also fictional. But that just made it better: The actress who played her on “Living Single,” Dana Owens, better known as Queen Latifah, was from New Jersey — just like me.Today I laugh at my early-90s notion of making it. Yet, at its core, it never really changed. My American dream was to not mess up. My dream was to defy expectations. To be unpredictable, to do something better and something more than my ancestors did.The American dream, the idea that anyone can succeed through hard work, is one of the most enduring myths in this country. And one of its most prominent falsehoods. As I entered my 30s, still navigating what achieving the dream would mean, I wondered what other black millennials were feeling. I wanted to figure out what my generation of black Americans thought about the promise of the American dream and how we can attain it. Over the course of several years, beginning in 2014 through last year, I spoke with more than 75 people in their 20s and 30s from places like New York; Raeford, N.C.; Jackson, Miss.; and New Orleans. They were Americans from various parts of the African diaspora, class backgrounds and sexual identities. Many of these black millennials told me that their dreams can’t be realized in the same ways as others’ can, particularly their white counterparts, despite perceptions of equality in this “woke” generation.They were frustrated by the reality of limited opportunities — and also frustrated that many people, including black people from different generations, didn’t understand why we couldn’t just pull up our pants, find a job with our fancy degrees and be happy. I had many of these conversations at a time when unarmed black men and women were being fatally shot by the police, which led to social movements, many led by people in my generation. But after it was proclaimed to the world that our lives mattered, as video after video of young black people being harassed continued to circulate widely, it often felt like opportunity and even justice would never be ours to claim.Today, young black Americans are not being chased down by dogs, we don’t have to fight to use the same restrooms and water fountains as people who don’t look like us. But we’re still tired of having to prove our humanity and trying to make sure that America makes good on its promise.I'm an early millennial or, as some people put it, an “old millennial” — meaning I am among the first of the generation that has come to be defined by this term. I attempted to claim a piece of my American dream through homeownership, and quickly I saw how much of a falsehood that dream could be.I bought my first home in August 2005. I was working as a production assistant at a television network and was excited that I would now have a visual marker of success. I was 25, just a few years out of college, and everything felt possible.At the time, I was making $28,000 a year — nothing much, especially when you live 10 minutes away from Manhattan — but credit was free flowing, and I qualified for a $250,000 “no doc” adjustable loan. It wasn’t a lot, but with some savings and some money that my mom and great-aunt promised to give me — a privilege a lot of black people don’t have — I knew I’d be able to make a 20 percent down payment.Almost all of my closest family members owned their home: My grandparents, my great-aunt and, most important, my mother. She bought her home several years after I was born and constantly talked about how tough that was to do in the early 1980s as a single woman. She was always clear about the importance of owning your own things. It meant having control over your life; it meant freedom.So back in 2005, it seemed like a good idea to buy an apartment. I looked in Englewood, where I grew up, but across town from where I was raised, in the East Hill neighborhood. My mortgage broker told me I needed to get out of my adjustable loan in two years and get a conventional mortgage. She sort of warned me it was a bad deal, and I could understand why. But she didn’t warn me against doing it at all. She was black, middle-aged and seemed to take a “by any means necessary” approach to black people owning property. I understood that, too. I marched up to my new, small, one-bedroom apartment on the Hill, satisfied. It felt as if I’d broken barriers.But when I got a notice in the mail about five years after I closed, I felt dizzy. It was not long after the financial crisis. The letter said that my mortgage company had been charged with giving subprime loans to black and Hispanic people around the country and asked if I wanted to join a class-action suit. I had most likely been the target of predatory lending. I had known from the start that my income could make me a target. I’d heard the words of the broker. But because of my race? It hadn’t crossed my mind. I was devastated.I was reminded of this moment years later, when I was talking to a young man named Bleu who lived in Florida. He loved playing basketball, did well at his charter school and hoped to become a forensic scientist — the version of the American dream that rewards merit and achievement, his version of saving for a mortgage. His family had no resources to get him to college, though, and he took a job at a fast-food restaurant after graduating from high school. He tried to enroll in a for-profit college, but the monthly fees got too expensive. He dropped out after he missed the third payment. "
Basketball,"Herb Kelleher, who turned conventional airline industry wisdom on its head by combining low fares with high standards of customer service to build Southwest Airlines into one of the nation’s most successful and admired companies, died on Thursday. He was 87.The airline announced his death on Twitter. It did not say where he died or give a cause. Southwest is based in Dallas, and Mr. Kelleher had a home there.Under the fun-loving, chain-smoking, hard-drinking, New Jersey-born Mr. Kelleher, Southwest, which began in 1971 as a low-fare intrastate carrier serving three Texas cities — Houston, Dallas and San Antonio — grew into the behemoth that today carries more than 120 million passengers a year, making it the nation’s most popular domestic airline.Southwest employs more than 58,000 people and has been profitable every year since two years after it was founded. During Mr. Kelleher’s tenure, the company never had a layoff, furlough or pay cut, despite being among the most unionized airlines in the world.His vision for the airline — one that reshaped the industry — centered on using more fuel-efficient, low-cost planes to reduce fares and challenging his employees to provide no-frills service without lowering standards.Robert Mann, an airline industry analyst and former executive, said that by eliminating onerous fees and unnecessary services and using secondary airports, like Love Field in Dallas, Southwest brought low prices to the market and stimulated demand for air travel. Now, given a choice between driving and flying, legions of travelers opted for the plane.At a time when Braniff’s coach fare between Dallas and San Antonio was $62, for example, Southwest’s fare for the same route was $15. Mr. Kelleher stuck to the low-fare concept, believing that lower prices did not mean lower profits.“He literally brought air travel to the masses on a scale that was unimaginable,” Mr. Mann said. Southwest’s entry into a market inevitably led to lower fares across the board. This became known as the Southwest Effect.By paying his employees well, avoiding layoffs and instilling a spirit of fun in the company’s culture, Mr. Kelleher also set a tone for Southwest that translated into customer loyalty.“You have to treat your employees like customers,” he told Fortune magazine in 2001. “When you treat them right, then they will treat your outside customers right. That has been a powerful competitive weapon for us.”What sounded like a business cliché translated into tremendous cost savings for Southwest. Its employee productivity levels were far higher than those of the competition, and even as salaries rose, the company managed to keep fares low and profits high. The company was a perennial choice for Fortune’s “Most Admired Companies” list.When Mr. Kelleher stepped down as chairman at the annual shareholder meeting in 2008, he received “the kind of standing ovation usually reserved for rock stars,” The New York Times reported. Even the Southwest pilots union, in the midst of negotiating a new contract, took out a full-page advertisement in USA Today thanking him for all he had done.Mr. Kelleher’s quick-witted, down-home observations were legend in the industry. “Because I am unable to perform competently any meaningful function at Southwest, our employees let me be C.E.O.,” he once told the National Civil Aviation Review Commission. “That is one among many reasons why I love the people of Southwest Airlines.”A hard drinker with an ever-present Kool cigarette in his mouth, he liked to dress like Elvis Presley or other characters at company meetings and maintain a level of fun in the workplace.In 1992, when both Southwest and Stevens Aviation were using the advertising tagline “Just Plane Smart,” the companies got locked into a debate over which had the rights to the idea. Mr. Kelleher suggested that in place of litigation, he and Kurt Herwald, the Stevens chief executive, arm-wrestle for it. And though Mr. Kelleher lost the match, the publicity was so positive that Mr. Herwald relented and let Southwest keep the tagline."
Basketball,"Frank Robinson, the Hall of Fame outfielder who hit 586 home runs and became a racial pioneer as the first black manager in the major leagues, nearly three decades after Jackie Robinson broke modern baseball’s color barrier playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers, died on Thursday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 83.Major League Baseball announced the death but did not specify the cause. The Baltimore Sun recently reported that Robinson was in the late stages of a long illness.Playing for 21 seasons, mostly with the Cincinnati Reds and the Baltimore Orioles, Robinson was the only winner of the Most Valuable Player Award in both the National and American Leagues.He was an intense and often intimidating presence, leaning over the plate from his right-handed stance, daring pitchers to hit him (which they did, 198 times), then retaliating with long drives, “pounding pitchers with fine impartiality,” as the baseball writer Roger Kahn once wrote. He broke up double plays with fearsome slides.As a player, Robinson insisted that teammates match his own will to win. As a manager, he had little patience with lack of hustle.Robinson won baseball’s batting triple crown in 1966, hitting 49 home runs, driving in 122 runs and batting .316 in his first season with the Orioles and helping the team capture a World Series championship for the first time in franchise history.He batted at least .300 in nine different seasons, had 2,943 career hits, drove in 1,812 runs and played on five pennant-winning teams. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982, his first time on the ballot.Robinson made his debut as the majors’ first black manager with the Cleveland Indians on April 8, 1975, 28 years after Jackie Robinson (no relation) first took the field with the Dodgers. Rachel Robinson, Jackie Robinson’s widow, threw out the ceremonial first ball.Frank Robinson, who was still an active player, punctuated the historic occasion by hitting a home run in his first at-bat, as the designated hitter, leading the Indians to a 5-3 victory over the Yankees.He managed for all or parts of 16 seasons, with the Indians (1975-77), the San Francisco Giants (1981-84), the Orioles (1988-91), the Montreal Expos (2002-04) and their successor franchise, the Washington Nationals (2005-06). He never managed a pennant winner, but the Baseball Writers Association of America named him the American League manager of the year in 1989, when his Orioles finished second in the East Division, two games behind the Toronto Blue Jays.“He had great, great baseball instincts and tremendous physical attributes that allowed him to do everything right on a ball field,” the former Orioles manager Earl Weaver wrote in his memoir, “It’s What You Learn After You Know It All That Counts” (1982).As Weaver put it: “He never griped and he was always willing to counsel any younger players who sought his advice. At times I know he counseled a few who didn’t seek him out when he heard them complaining. ‘That’s enough!’ he’d holler. ‘Don’t rock the boat.’ ”The Orioles’ Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Palmer told Baseball Digest in 2006 that Robinson’s arrival in Baltimore via a trade with Cincinnati had kindled the franchise’s resurgence. “If Frank saw something, Frank was going to say something,” Palmer said. “When he came over here, he was the leader. He was the guy. He made us all better.”Another of the Orioles’ leading pitchers of that time, Dave McNally, was quoted in John Eisenberg’s oral history of the team, “From 33rd Street to Camden Yards” (2000): “As good as Frank was, it was how hard he played that really made an impact. The intensity the man had was really incredible.”Frank Robinson was born on Aug. 31, 1935, in Beaumont, Tex., and grew up in Oakland, Calif., the youngest of 10 children. He played baseball at McClymonds High School in Oakland, where he was a basketball teammate of Bill Russell’s. He signed with the Reds’ organization in 1953 and made his major league debut as Cincinnati’s left fielder three years later."
Basketball,"Twenty-five years ago, on April 5, 1994, Kurt Cobain died at the age of 27, a victim of suicide. He left behind the epochal rock music he made as the singer and guitarist for Nirvana, piles of journals and artwork, and a final note that didn’t clear up the contradictions of his short life. Which was probably how he wanted it: The previous year, he had painted on the wall of his rented Seattle home, in large red block letters, “None of You Will Ever Know My Intentions.”Many Nirvana biographies rehash the basics of Cobain’s story or peddle conspiracy theories that he was murdered, but there are also plenty of ways to go deeper. Here’s what to read, listen to, watch and explore:‘Journals’ (Riverhead)With nearly 300 pages of photo replicas of Cobain’s personal journals and letters (and doodles, sketches and song lists), this 2002 book is funny, painful and shockingly intimate: a guided tour of the singer’s own churning psyche. “Its hard to decipher the difference between a sincere entertainer and an honest swindler,” Cobain wrote. Here’s what The New York Times’s Neil Strauss wrote when the book came out.‘Come as You Are’ (Three Rivers)This deeply reported 1993 biography by Michael Azerrad, first published while Cobain was alive, was the original bible for Nirvana fans. Its strongest passages evoke the life of young Cobain in Aberdeen, Wash., a child of divorce who would sometimes spend the weekend killing time at a local logging company where his father worked: “He would get into his dad’s van and listen to Queen’s ‘News of the World’ over and over again on the eight-track. Sometimes he’d listen so long that he’d drain the battery and they’d have to find someone to jump-start the engine.”‘Heavier Than Heaven’ (Hachette)Charles R. Cross, formerly the editor of the Seattle music paper The Rocket, covered the Nirvana story from early on — and conducted over 400 interviews for this thorough, definitive 2001 biography. Cobain’s widow, the musician Courtney Love, granted Cross extensive interviews and access to Cobain’s archives, including arcana such as a visual assignment he completed during his final stay in rehab: “For ‘surrender,’ he drew a man with a bright light emanating from him. For ‘depressed,’ he showed an umbrella surrounded by ties.” Read The New York Times review.‘Takeoff: The Oral History of Nirvana’s Crossover Moment’ (Cuepoint)When Nirvana’s “Nevermind” hit No. 1 soon after its 1991 release, it shocked the band members and their grunge cohort, who had assumed that at best, the group would be underground heroes. Its multiplatinum success also opened the doors for many Nirvana-bes. This oral history by Nick Soulsby tells that story from the viewpoint of Nirvana’s college-rock peers, such as Gary Floyd of opening act Sister Double Happiness remembering Nirvana’s “road manager telling everyone backstage one night the CD had hit 1 million sales that day. They seemed almost embarrassed.”‘The Dark Side of Kurt Cobain’ (The Advocate)Cobain loudly and frequently declared himself as an ally of gay people (and women, and people of color), so it was fitting that he gave one of his best interviews in this 1993 cover story with The Advocate, telling Kevin Allman, “I’ve always been a really sickly, feminine person anyhow, so I thought I was gay for a while because I didn’t find any of the girls in my high school attractive at all.”‘Kurt Cobain, The Rolling Stone Interview: Success Doesn’t Suck’ (Rolling Stone)In Cobain’s last major interview, he informed David Fricke that he had wanted to call Nirvana’s “In Utero” album “I Hate Myself and I Want to Die,” “but I knew the majority of the people wouldn’t understand.” He insisted that the suicidal sentiment was only a joke: “I’m a much happier guy than a lot of people think I am.”‘Never More’ (The Village Voice)"

Basketball,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]HANCOCK, N.Y. — Deep in the dense woods near the Catskill Mountains, a settlement was started decades ago by Muslim families, many of them African-Americans from New York City, who were seeking to distance themselves from neighborhoods they saw as dangerous and laden with corrosive influences. Holy Islamberg was intended to be a refuge, a serene environment to pray and bring up children.In the years since, the enclave’s residents have forged relationships with state and local law enforcement, and made connections with their non-Muslim neighbors from nearby towns. They work alongside each other in medical clinics and offices. Their children are teammates in youth football and basketball games.But residents of Islamberg have found that there is no such thing as a safe haven in the internet age.Conspiracy theorists and anti-Muslim groups have sketched a false portrayal of the community as a hidden-away den of Islamic extremism. Last week, the police in Greece, N.Y., roughly 200 miles away, arrested four young people who are accused of amassing a stockpile of firearms and homemade bombs with plans to target the community.The plot was the second major one on Islamberg to be thwarted by the authorities in recent years.The threatened violence reflects how Islamberg has become fodder for a pernicious part of the internet, one steeped in virulent hate and misinformation spread by websites like 4chan and Infowars, alongside baseless theories like Pizzagate and QAnon.“These kids in Greece, they’ve never been to Islamberg,” said Hussein Adams, chief executive of the Muslims of America and a resident whose family has lived in the community for three generations. “They go on the internet and they’re fed all this fake news and all this misinformation, and they come up with a plan.”Mr. Adams and other residents said they subscribe to a faith based on love and respect.And the local authorities said the swirl of online conspiracy theories about Islamberg were unfounded.“They are law-abiding,” said Maj. William F. McEvoy, the State Police commander in the region. “They are positive, solid members of the community.”Islamberg has about 200 residents, some from families who have lived here for two or more generations, and covers some 60 acres outside Binghamton, near the Pennsylvania state line and about 150 miles from New York City. It is set back off a bumpy road on private property, up steep slopes, past pastures and alongside a creek.The winter conditions can be punishing, with snow and ice making the community even harder to reach. Still, residents have a spread of land offering enough room to build homes and a mosque and raise livestock and crops.Islamberg was started around 1980 by a group of mostly African-Americans who converted to Islam in the 1960s and followed Sheihk Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani, a Pakistani cleric and founder of Muslims of America.He encouraged his followers to flee large cities and build communes in rural areas where they could separate themselves from the crime and the violence they faced in their old neighborhoods and the decadence that, in his view, pervaded secular society. Over the years, his followers have set up about a dozen other villages similar to Islamberg, including ones in Virginia, Georgia and Tennessee."
Basketball,"Good Tuesday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)In the face of flagging iPhone sales, Apple unveiled an audacious plan yesterday to dominate the digital services that run on its devices — a new monthly subscription service for TV programming, video games and news, as well as a new credit card. But it failed to spell out why anyone should take the company up on its offer.• Apple TV Plus will offer new original content, as well as programs from channels like HBO and Showtime. Reese Witherspoon, Steven Spielberg and Jennifer Aniston took the stage to make the announcement, but details — even about fundamentals like pricing — were glaringly absent.• Apple News Plus gives access to 300 magazines, including The New Yorker and National Geographic, as well as newspapers like the LAT and the WSJ for $9.99 a month. But it’s unclear whether you’ll get all the content — business stories and analysis will remain exclusive to full WSJ subscribers, who pay $39 a month, for example — so it’s not quite as robust an offering as it first seems.• Apple Arcade is a video game subscription service that will launch later this year. Surprise: No details were given about how much it would cost, or which games would be included.• Apple Card is the company’s new credit card, which has been developed with Goldman Sachs. It’s meant to work mainly on the iPhone, with users receiving 2 percent cash back on the same day if they make purchases through Apple Pay. Some important questions you might have — such as credit limit and interest rate — weren’t answered.The company is betting that consumers will be tempted by the convenience (and, presumably, slick experience) of having one company provide every scrap of content to them. But its success will rest on the quality of the content and the value on offer — and we still have little idea about either.Lobbyists for clients like Uber and Handy are pressing legislatures to keep workers from being deemed employees, Noam Scheiber of the NYT writes:• In December, a Texas regulator proposed that companies using a “digital network” to dispatch workers, as Uber does with car drivers, could label them contractors rather than employees.• That’s a big deal for gig-economy companies, who want to designate workers as contractors to avoid paying unemployment insurance and overtime, saving billions.• This month, it came to light that Tusk Ventures, a venture-capital and political-strategy firm, appears to have been the primary author of the Texas proposal.• Tusk was retained by the on-demand cleaning and repairs company Handy, and is run by Bradley Tusk, once a top political consultant for Uber and a large shareholder who could make millions when the company goes public.• Tusk has also pursued similar efforts in other states, like Illinois.• “Worker advocacy groups say the goal is to chip away at classification rules in enough places to create pressure for a broad exemption nationally,” Mr. Scheiber writes.Last year, Michael Avenatti became a celebrity for representing Stormy Daniels, the adult film star, in her fight against President Trump. Yesterday, he was arrested for what prosecutors said was an attempted shakedown of Nike."
Basketball,"WOODMERE, N.Y. — If there is a world in which theater kids rule, Andrew Barth Feldman seems to live there.He wanders through the halls of his high school — a lank, 5-foot-6, Disney-obsessed 16-year-old prone to bursting into song — like the mayor. Photos of him dot the hallways. Teachers stop mid-lesson when they spot him in the hallway, hoping he’ll come in and say hello to their classes. A basketball star in the cafeteria smiles and waves. The little kids in the library gawk as they hurtle by.He’s long been a standout in their world — the kid who was organizing flash mobs at fourth-grade assembly, who founded his own theater company at 12 (it’s still going), who has been acting in school plays and camp shows and community theater productions for as long as anyone can remember.And now he’s going to Broadway.Even in an industry that delights in discovery, this teenager’s right-place-right-time story is one for the books: Last June, he was competing in the National High School Musical Theater Awards (known as the Jimmys) — which he won — when the lead producer of “Dear Evan Hansen” happened to be in the audience.She knew immediately she wanted him for the show, and on Jan. 30, he assumes the title role, playing Broadway’s favorite socially anxious and ethically confused adolescent.“I’m so nervous all the time about it,” he said, cleareyed, candid, and strikingly courteous as we talked in an empty classroom. “If I were to make my Broadway debut in any role, it’s Evan,” he added, somehow managing to be confident and self-doubting at the same time. “This is my favorite show since I saw it, and everyone has always said I’m right for the role. I think I agree.”The role is wrenching, vocally and emotionally, and Andrew will be the first teenager to tackle it on Broadway. The character is 17, but adolescent boys are often thought to be too immature to play adolescent boys, and all of his predecessors have been in their 20s; Ben Platt, who won a Tony Award originating the role, was 23 when the show opened.“There’s the possibility of getting us something that’s authentic and original and vital and has never been seen,” said the show’s director, Michael Greif.Andrew is so young — and so new to the rigors of Broadway — that he’s going to begin his run doing just five performances a week, while taking vocal lessons to shore up his stamina. This will be his first professional production, and the creative team, determined to protect him as well as their smash-hit show, has decided the reduced schedule is their way of investing in his long-term success; the show’s alternate, Michael Lee Brown, will do the other three performances as Andrew builds comfort and strength.“It’s a little scary for all of us — for him, for me, for his mom — because we’re asking a lot of him,” said Stacey Mindich, the show’s lead producer. “But in every single moment he has grown with us already — at every passage he has shown us he is uber-capable.”This is not one of those stories about someone who happened into theater unwittingly. This is a story about an unabashed theater geek — a child who has adored Broadway since he saw “Beauty and the Beast” at age 3, who has been happily singing on stage since he landed the role of Mr. Bundles in a community theater production of “Annie” at age 8; who writes songs and plays the piano, guitar, drums, ukulele and bass; who has been to all four editions of BroadwayCon, including the one last year where he won a lip-syncing competition while performing as Angelica Schuyler from “Hamilton.”His passion for the imaginary goes way beyond musicals. He’s a huge fan of “Star Wars” — “We watched ‘A New Hope’ in English class to learn about archetypes, and I was like, ‘Oh my God, this is the coolest thing’” — and has dressed as General Grievous and Kylo Ren for Halloween. (It’s not that he’s drawn to the dark side; it’s just, he says, that those characters look cooler.)He’s an even huger fan of Disney (which now owns “Star Wars,” so maybe that’s redundant). He estimates that he’s been to Disney theme parks, including Disneyworld, Disneyland and Disneyland Paris, at least 20 times, starting when he was 6 months old. “Something draws me to the idea of being able to live in another world,” he said.And now he really, really loves “Dear Evan Hansen.” The first time he saw the musical, a couple of weeks after it opened on Broadway in 2016, he was so overcome he couldn’t find the words to talk about it when his mother came to pick him up."
Basketball,"To the Editor:My admittance to Stanford was my golden ticket to a college nicknamed “Paradise,” where learning from Pulitzer Prize-winning authors and being mentored by paradigm-changing scientists were normal. Stanford opened doors I never even knew existed, having grown up in a small, agricultural town in Northern California. A little thing called an “endowment” changed my life. When I graduated in 2018, I was no longer a small-town girl, but rather a young adult, itching to contribute something meaningful. Stanford transformed my flimsy desire to become a doctor into a fiery passion to become a leader in health care — all because I had witnessed this leadership in my mentors and friends.Today, I still question what it means to attend an “elite” college, especially as admissions scandals unfold. But what I do know is that these colleges can open doors for those who want to rectify flawed systems and are hungry to elevate others. Small-town girls like me just need the exposure. To those on admissions committees: Admit more of us. Doing so can improve communities and generations to come.Shin Mei ChanSan FranciscoTo the Editor:I have a vivid recollection of the conversation that occurred in the parking lot of an independent prep school where I taught years ago. A colleague asked me, somewhat incredulously, “Wait a minute — you went to a state college?” There was a pause as I nodded in the affirmative, then came the kicker: “Oh, but I thought you were brilliant.”In places such as these, and too often in the job market, attending an “elite” college matters very much. The fact is, it shouldn’t matter at all. My dad was retired; we could not afford an expensive college. I earned a full-tuition scholarship and paid my own way. I pursued graduate work at an “elite” engineering school and earned an advanced degree from a large university. Neither was inherently superior in terms of the education it delivered.The college experiences that shaped my life the most centered around getting to know people from diverse backgrounds and learning to solve problems independently. Where or if a person went to college should matter far less than what a person has learned and become along the way in life.George WhittemorePrinceton, Mass.To the Editor:My community college experience saved my life. After graduating from high school, moving around and floundering in minimum-wage jobs, I returned to my hometown to live with my parents. I was depressed and attempted suicide. During my recovery, I started attending the community college in my hometown. At first, I resisted enrolling in our local community college because I felt there was a stigma. But when I did, I found a menagerie of students from all walks of life and professors who were deeply passionate about their students.Class by class, the depression that had held me down for so long began to lift. I joined the honors program and then helped mentor other students. I presented at an undergraduate research conference. Along the way, I met my fiancé and built a network of peers and mentors who helped me get where I am today.I cannot emphasize enough the importance of community colleges. Their support systems, small and tight-knit communities, and affordability are truly unrivaled. Today, I am working to destigmatize the college experience I owe everything to.Sarah OlsonCorvallis, Ore.The writer will be an undergraduate transfer student at Oregon State University in the fall."
Basketball,"Ours is a noisy country. We’ve been rebellious, insolent shouters since the beginning. We invent freak shows and circuses and casinos. Talk too loud. Our public spaces honk and whistle at us. We believe ourselves stars just awaiting a stage. We’re a people, Walt Whitman crooned, “singing, with open mouths,” our “strong melodious songs.” We chew with open mouths, too — we’re without pretense or much regard for personal space. Our latest, greatest gift to the world is a computer for your pocket that chatters at you all day long. And then there’s the past two years: political and technological churn, offense and outrage. Noise incarnate.It would be easy to forget, especially these days, that American DNA contains another trait — though clearly a recessive one: the desire to disappear.There’s Thoreau’s pond and Kerouac’s road and Cheryl Strayed’s Pacific Crest Trail, places that couldn’t be farther away from Times Square. There’s the silent man (it’s almost always a man) who must go off alone to discover himself, lose himself, away from the noise, sailing down the Mississippi on a raft. “I am reduced to my irreducible self,” the poet and essayist Wendell Berry wrote in “An Entrance to the Woods,” after camping alone along Kentucky’s Red River Gorge. “As I leave the bare expanse of the rock and go in under the trees again, I am aware that I move in the landscape as one of its details.”Are we still capable of such smallness? The minuscule human figures in a Thomas Cole painting, dwarfed by overwhelming mountains and an engulfing sky, once embodied an American ideal, the purposeful melting away of individuality in order to attain some higher awareness, or to join in a collective or simply to find space to think. With our societal volume dial turned all the way up (and possibly broken), so many of us overexposed and all too present, does quiet any longer have this pull, or does it just make us itch for our phones? And if we can still shut our eyes and cover our ears, become details of the landscape, should we? Is it morally acceptable at this moment? What’s waiting for us beyond the noise if we try?Two new books on the value of invisibility and silence seem like a clever bit of counterprogramming. Coming upon them was like finding the Advil bottle in the medicine cabinet after stumbling about with a headache for a long time. They are both, perhaps purposefully, slow reads. They demand patience from addled minds primed to see such subject matter as a result of subtraction, the blank pages between chapters.Akiko Busch, the author of an essay collection, HOW TO DISAPPEAR: Notes on Invisibility in an Age of Transparency (Penguin Press, $26), disputes this premise. For her, invisibility is not simply a negative, the inverse of visibility. Going unseen, undetected, overlooked: These are experiences with their own inherent “meaning and power”; what we need is a “field guide” for recognizing them.And this is what Busch offers, roaming from essay to essay in a loose, associative style, following invisibility where it takes her — from childhood and the comfort of imaginary friends to middle age and the feeling of disappearing as a sexual object: a sensation, she argues, that can form the basis of a new, and positive, form of selfhood. She regards some contemporary art, like Cindy Sherman’s distorted self-portraits and Alec Soth’s  “Unselfies,” as signals of our deep desire to smudge our identities and keep them at least partly hidden. One essay considers the “improvisational choreography” of rush hour in Grand Central Terminal, the crowd a thing of pleasure to get lost in, she writes, our pace “quickening and slowing in sync with those around us.”Inconspicuousness can be powerful — this may be Busch’s most radical point, especially at a moment when we’re conditioned to think power means yelling louder than everyone else in your Twitter feed, or showing the world on Instagram how you’re living your best life. Consider the arctic fox or the Indonesian crab, animals that deploy camouflage to survive. For them, “becoming invisible is not the equivalent of being nonexistent,” Busch writes. “Invisibility is a strategy for attracting a mate, protecting home and habitat, hunting and defense. Camouflage in the natural world is not some exotic and picturesque trait. It is nuanced, creative, sensitive, discerning.” Humans use it in this way, too.In one essay Busch goes scuba diving and makes her best case for giving invisibility more room in our lives. Underwater, she is enchanted by the sensation of being completely ignored: “Forty feet beneath the surface, the striped parrotfish are oblivious to me. The yellowtail damselfish and flurry of silversides couldn’t be less interested.” This feeling of superfluousness combined with weightlessness and the meditative sound of her own breathing allow her to hold her ego at an arm’s length: “We all know that sensation of life slowing down, of being suspended in time, of being outside the rhythm of ordinary life, but underwater, that is the way things really are.”As much as anyone else, I fantasize about checking out. I would love to remove the pinging notifications from my days, for my mind to wander without being thrown askew by each incoming tweet. But visions of total unplugging also seem a bit grotesque.Think of Erik Hagerman, a former corporate executive at Nike, who decided shortly after the 2016 election to blockade the outside world, rigorously avoiding all news as if it might kill him. A New York Times profile last year followed him to a cafe where he plugged into white noise and read only the weather report. He watched basketball games on mute. His life seemed sad and lonely, not exhilarating. His decision to disengage was also, particularly now, the height of irresponsibility, an abdication of that most basic duty of citizenship: staying informed. Or consider the unnamed protagonist of Ottessa Moshfegh’s recent novel, “My Year of Rest and Relaxation,” who decides to take enough drugs to, literally, sleep for a year: “If I kept going, I thought, I’d disappear completely, then reappear in some new form. This was my hope. This was the dream.” But there is nothing hopeful about her hibernation. It is the act of a vacuous narcissist.How much silence is too much? Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk who was among the most influential Catholic thinkers of the 20th century, pondered this question intently. What drew him to the Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky was the opportunity for a life of quiet contemplation. His greatest fantasy, he wrote, was “to deliver oneself up, to hand oneself over, entrust oneself completely to the silence of a wide landscape of woods and hills, or sea, or desert; to sit still while the sun comes up over that land and fills its silences with light.”When his popularity as an author made it more difficult to achieve solitude, he retreated even further, living for long stretches by himself in a toolshed in the hills of the monastery grounds. But the world intruded, particularly in the 1950s and ’60s, as the Cold War ramped up and a nuclear standoff seemed imminent. He began to wonder whether the life he had constructed for himself, so sustaining to his soul, justified the disengagement.Merton’s dilemma is central to Jane Brox’s SILENCE: A Social History of One of the Least Understood Elements of Our Lives (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $27), her meditation on the pain and the joy of being quiet. “When is silence power?” Brox imagines Merton asking himself. “When is it an accomplice to fear?” Merton did not want to contribute to what he repeatedly called the “noise” of American society (“the noise of slogans or the repetition of clichés”; “the amplified noise of beasts”). But he also knew it wasn’t right to ignore his own stake in the world’s problems. What he sought instead was a “genuine and deep communication,” one achieved, he insisted, only through a continuous recharging in silence. The very element that might seem to make us bad citizens or antisocial is at the same time a prerequisite for thoughtfulness and more profound connection with others. Since most of us can’t yo-yo in and out of solitude (despite the meditation apps that promise to help us do just that), we have to live with this paradox.If in her book Busch meanders, pulling from her array of examples a generally positive appraisal of invisibility, Brox hunkers down in two institutions dominated by the absence of noise — prison and the monastery — and leaves us with a much more ambiguous sense of silence: oppressive under certain conditions, liberating under others. For her prison, she chooses Eastern State, opened in 1829 just outside Philadelphia as a new, idealistic sort of penitentiary dreamed up by Benjamin Rush, a reformer and friend of Benjamin Franklin, who wanted to deploy solitude as a means to redemption. Brox alternates sections on the prison’s history with ones on the medieval order of Cistercian monks, who structured their lives around silence, which they too saw as a means to redemption."
Basketball,"ATHENS — It is about time I told you what I have really been doing here the past few months. It hasn’t all been visits to archaeological sites and meditations on the contemporary relevance of antiquity. Today I’d like to put ancient history on hold for a moment and move from the past right into the present.It might be objected that what I have been writing is a series of postcards, perhaps with lots of local color and historical background, but nonetheless a kind of high-end philosophical tourism from famous Athenian locations. Perhaps this can’t be avoided. I am, after all, a foreigner and a temporary resident. And this city’s monuments, with their beauty and historical grandeur, exert a pull like virtually no others. But is there perhaps a better way of connecting with ordinary Athenians, with their habits and routines? Maybe I could get closer to their lives in the vast modern Agora of this metropolis through a common passion. A passion for soccer. And what site could be more ordinary than a pub?I am a lifelong fan of Liverpool Football Club and spend much more time than I care to confess watching games, reading about soccer, listening to podcasts and watching endless YouTube clips of highlights, news conferences and often rather tedious match analysis. I will talk to any poor soul I can find about my team and about theirs, although I prefer mine. Yet — much to my constant amazement — there exist people in the world who do not care for the beautiful game.Liverpool were playing the day after I arrived in Athens in early January. I urgently needed to find out where to watch live games because the TV in my apartment was pretty basic. On the morning of match day, I dipped into the internet and discovered a promising-looking Facebook page for “The Pan-Hellenic Liverpool Friends Club.” I sent a message, more in hope than expectation.Three minutes later, I got a reply: “Good morning m8. You can meet us in the Wee Dram pub. It is a Scottish pub. Ask for John.”I got there early and asked for John. It was like meeting a long-lost friend. John Skotidas founded the official Liverpool supporters club in 1995 and has been running it ever since with a good deal of organizational skill. It has 1,100 members, and Liverpool are the most popular English team in Greece. I’ve gotten to know John quite well in the time I have been here. He was an aircraft engineer with the Greek Air Force for 27 years, before retiring at age 46 to pursue his other passion, watching and talking about soccer. John even has his own YouTube channel. He became a Liverpool fan after seeing the Beatles on TV when he was a kid in the late 1960s. He just liked the name “Liverpool.” It sounded good. When he was 10 years old, he watched them play for the first time against Newcastle United in the FA Cup final in 1974 and decided to support them. He has been a fan ever since.I also met a number of other people in the bar on that first day: Scotty, Kris, Spiros (who promotes Bollywood movies in Greece, which are apparently pretty popular) and a bunch of other Greek fans. I watched my first game with them on Jan. 12, Liverpool versus Brighton. It was an edgy match, but with a confident defensive display from us, we won 1-0 (“one-nil”).Since then, I’ve watched an awful lot of games at the Wee Dram, and it has developed into a ritual of sorts. I have a talked a fair bit about the nature of ritual in this series, whether the processional pomp of the City of Dionysia, the Divine Liturgy of Mount Athos or the Greater Mysteries of Eleusis. Watching soccer is an undoubtedly lesser mystery, with a more humble and humdrum set of ritual actions, but they also have meaning. And every fan has their rituals and superstitions.Before leaving the apartment, I carefully select my Liverpool shirt, track suit or scarf (depending on the weather, but I always look a teensy bit ridiculous) and walk to Syntagma or Constitution Square. I descend into the underworld of the subway system, take the four stops to Panormou station, buy a piece of spanakopita or sumptuous spinach pie from the bakery, walk slowly uphill eating it, get to the Wee Dram, push open the door, scan the room for seats and look for John. He’s always sitting in the same spot (it’s a superstition, he told me), just next to the big TV, head down, looking at his phone. Although I always try to get there early, the place is usually packed. John seems to have a secret supply of stools that he will whip out if a regular comes in late and the place is too crammed with fans.John gives the nod, says a few words, and a seat opens up. I shake hands with everyone, ask them how they are doing, head to the bar, buy a pint of Murphy’s (they don’t sell Guinness), sit down and check the WhatsApp connection with my son Edward in London. We exchange a couple of short messages like “I’m in position. You?” and then discuss the team lineup and usually wonder why our German coach Juergen Klopp has included or left out a player we particularly like. The Wi-Fi tends to keep dropping, which occasions much dashing out into the street.The Wee Dram is owned by Ross, who incidentally used to play for the Scottish national basketball team (I didn’t know they had one) and supports Hearts of Midlothian. To each their own. The pub has two main areas, a glass-walled central room where you can buy drinks, which is where the younger lads tend to gather, standing together in small groups, often wearing Liverpool shirts, and a larger outside area with older fans, sitting or standing. I prefer to sit, at least until something really exciting happens and then I stand and retreat backward to the door of the pub, so I don’t block anyone’s view. For reasons that completely escape me, I often crouch with my arms at a right angle and fists softly clenched. It’s almost an attitude of prayer.There’s a large wooden central rectangular table with benches where the hard-core fans sit, with John in pole position, top left. Most of them are smoking (Athens is a great place to pick up a passive smoking habit. Smoking is banned, of course, but Greeks tend to do what they want), drinking beer or coffee and betting online on their phones. Just behind the central table is another, smaller table with about four or five seats, marked “reserved” (although it turns out that all the tables are “reserved”). This is where I sit, usually with some familiar faces. We talk to one another as much as we can, in broken English and fragmentary Greek, but in great detail about the qualities of particular players, tactics, formation and the strength of the opposition. Although we don’t really know one another that well, there is an immense of feeling of familiarity, affection and trust.For the non-fan, it’s hard to explain how detailed these discussions are and the extraordinary levels of knowledge that ordinary fans possess. Although this might sound stupid, there is an amazing rational intelligence to soccer talk, bolstered by a common passion for the team that we all love.The teams emerge, I sit up straight, and there is the usual fluff of TV commercials and dumb graphics before kickoffs. We all clap when the whistle blows, and then we enter the shared and strangely meditative flow of the game. Things get really quiet. There is always an odd experience of tension in watching a game with a group of fellow fans, waiting for your team to score or at least have a shot or engage in a compelling passage of play. The TV in the Wee Dram has useless speakers, and it is a real strain to catch the Greek commentary. Not really understanding the words, I listen eagerly for the names, which have an almost magical aura: Van Dijk, Robertson, Sadio Mane, Milner, Alexander-Arnold.Of course, there are a lot of complaints, when there is a misplaced pass or especially when our star forward player, Mohammed Salah, shoots and misses, which has been happening a lot of late. The most frequently heard word in the bar is “malakas.” Let’s just say this is a word with a wide range of semantic connotations, many of them connected with the sin of onanism. There is a visceral connection between soccer and swearing, and I am at my most disgustingly foul-mouthed when watching Liverpool play. I am not proud of this fact and often try to swallow the vowel after the first consonant of the bad word has spilled from my lips."
Basketball,"Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of TV shows and movies to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for February, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice.‘Back to the Future’Starts streaming: Feb. 1Netflix is adding all three “Back to the Future” movies at the beginning of February, but the first remains a high-water mark of blockbuster filmmaking, both a technical marvel and an exquisitely crafted mix of screwball comedy and science fiction. The director Robert Zemeckis and his longtime screenwriting partner Bob Gale have an appreciation for the mechanics of the form, those tiny gears and springs that make complicated storytelling look effortless. There’s plenty of fun to be had in watching Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) go back to the ‘50s to save his scientist friend (Christopher Lloyd) and play matchmaker to his own parents, but “Back to the Future” is also an intricately worked-out time travel movie.‘Nocturnal Animals’Starts streaming: Feb. 1For his follow-up to the impeccable 2009 debut feature “A Single Man,” the designer turned director Tom Ford stirred some controversy with “Nocturnal Animals,” a neo-noir that opens with a much-talked-about montage of women dancing in the nude and gets more provocative from there. The extreme archness of Ford’s style proves a good match for the material, a matryoshka doll of narratives about an art gallery owner (Amy Adams) whose first husband (Jake Gyllenhaal) surprises her with a manuscript of his novel. Michael Shannon is particularly good in the story-within-a-story as a West Texas detective assigned to sort through a grisly kidnapping and murder case.‘Schindler’s List’Starts streaming: Feb. 1After surfacing in theaters last year for its 25th anniversary, Steven Spielberg’s Holocaust drama arrives on Netflix as a timely reminder of the human potential for evil and its equal capacity for courage and compassion. Shooting in a black and white that’s alternately stark and lustrous, Spielberg looks at history through the complicated lens of a German businessman (Liam Neeson) who staffs a Krakow factory with mostly Jewish workers and succeeds in protecting them from extermination once the SS comes around. Ralph Fiennes gives a chilling performance as an SS second lieutenant who oversees the construction of a concentration camp at Krakow and brings in captives from liquidated Jewish ghettos.‘The Lego Batman Movie’Starts streaming: Feb. 1After Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan moved the Caped Crusader in an increasingly dark direction — to say nothing of the outright drudgery of Ben Affleck in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” — the Batman character really needed to lighten up a bit. “The Lego Batman Movie” does the great service of taking him down a peg, with a gravel-voiced Will Arnett playing a vain, egomaniacal jerk who doesn’t work well with others and wants to take all the credit for himself. As with all the Lego movies, this one is chockablock with pop culture references and playroom action sequences, but it carries a well-realized theme about the value of friendship and teamwork, and how real heroes don’t have to go it alone.[Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Sign up for our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.]‘Velvet Buzzsaw’Starts streaming: Feb. 1Five years after teaming up for “Nightcrawler,” their searing critique of if-it-bleeds-it-leads journalism, the director Dan Gilroy and Jake Gyllenhaal have reunited for the art-world satire “Velvet Buzzsaw,” which arrives on Netflix less than a week after its Sundance premiere. The macabre premise sees an art critic (Gyllenhaal) and an influential gallery owner (Rene Russo) descend on a collection of paintings from a dead artist who had wanted them destroyed. Instead, the paintings are literally destroying the lives of those who are buying and selling them for outrageous fees.‘Won’t You Be My Neighbor?’Starts streaming: Feb. 1For those who grew up watching “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” from cribs and playpens, Morgan Neville’s documentary about Fred Rogers is an insta-cry, tapping into memories from an age before creating memories was possible. But even younger generations should find plenty to appreciate about “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?,” which paints Rogers as a friendly radical who broke every television rule to speak directly to children. Rejecting all commercial considerations, Rogers held theme weeks on divorce, poverty and death, and offered gentle guidance for his most vulnerable viewers.‘The 40-Year-Old Virgin’Starts streaming: Feb. 6"
Basketball,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]Since the blockbuster musical “Hamilton,” tourists have been swarming Trinity Church, part of an Episcopal parish in Lower Manhattan that dates to the 17th century. Alexander Hamilton and his wife, Eliza Schuyler Hamilton, are buried in the cemetery there.Recent years have been good to the church and the rest of its campus. St. Paul’s Chapel, near the World Trade Center, escaped destruction during the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and now gleams following a fresh coat of paint. After a cleaning in September, Hamilton’s white marble obelisk also sparkles. Soon the entire church — and a new $350 million glass tower under construction behind it — will, too.It makes sense. If a founding father can get a 21st-century update, so can the church where he is buried. Especially since the church in question is very, very rich.While many places of worship are warding off developers as they struggle to hold on to their congregations and buildings, Trinity is a big-time developer itself.The church has always been land-rich. And it has long had its own real estate arm, which controls ground leases and office space rentals in the buildings it owns. But now it finds itself with a newly diversified portfolio worth $6 billion, according to the current rector, the Rev. Dr. William Lupfer.After being instrumental in changing the zoning laws in Hudson Square, a neighborhood between West Houston and Canal Streets, Trinity Real Estate has entered into a joint venture that gives it a majority stake in 12 buildings that contain six million square feet of commercial space. A lucrative deal with the Walt Disney Company, valued at $650 million, was signed just last year.And as it builds its glass tower — which will house administrative offices, public gathering spaces and, yes, commercial tenants — Trinity is also renovating the interior of its historic church, which is expected to cost $110 million.Trinity has been able to do all this because it’s been a savvy manager of its resources. It is also, as a church, exempt from taxes.But some wonder about the ethics of a religious institution being such a power player in the world of New York real estate.“What is the fundamental economic issue going on that churches deserve tax exemption and can build up a lot of wealth?” asked Rachel M. McCleary, a lecturer in the economics department at Harvard University and co-author of the coming book “The Wealth of Religions: The Political Economy of Believing and Belonging.”Trinity’s current affluence can be traced to a gift of 215 acres from Queen Anne in 1705. (The church was first chartered, under King William III, in 1697, a few decades after the British took over New Amsterdam.) Trinity still owns 14 acres of that original land grant, mostly in Hudson Square.At the time Trinity received the land, of course, there was no separation of church and state. “They were a favored religion, and that gave them a leg up,” Dr. McCleary said. “The question becomes, How are they to be viewed in a pluralistic religion market, and what is their response in that market today?”Patti Walsh, a spokeswoman for the church, wrote in an email that Trinity handles such a market by working closely with other organizations to help them further their mission. “We currently work with many partners in New York City and around the world to build neighborhoods, to help develop clergy and lay leadership for the church, and to help our partners resource their ministries.”The current Trinity is the third church to be built at Broadway and Wall Street. Designed in a Gothic Revival style by Richard Upjohn and completed in 1846, the brownstone building was the tallest structure in the city for decades, and one of the first to be declared a landmark."
Basketball,"[Want to get this newsletter from Marc Stein each week — for free? Sign up here.]As the 2018-19 regular season dribbles to a close, with just two nights and 22 of 1,230 games to go, voters leaguewide are finalizing their year-end award ballots in six major categories. I am no longer one of them, because The New York Times does not permit its reporters to vote for such awards, but it’s still a useful exercise as we take stock of the season to break down each race and who I would have picked.Official selections are due Friday night and there is simply no wrong answer when choosing between Antetokounmpo and Houston’s James Harden for the top spot on the five-man M.V.P. ballot.I have always approached this category by trying to identify who had the best overall season — based on a subjective and imprecise mixture of individual and team success — rather than paying attention to the noise about which player is most widely regarded as the game’s best … or the best two-way player … or any other such designation.So who had the better 2018-19 season? I would go (ever so narrowly) with Giannis. On top of all his individual superlatives, Antetokounmpo has been the face and chief culture-setter in the Bucks’ transformation from 44-win underachiever to the best team in the league (regular-season edition). And his candidacy gets bonus points on our scorecard because Milwaukee, for Eastern Conference supremacy, had to beat out a trio of worthy challengers who were all projected as superior before the season.Harden would be tremendously unlucky to finish second in M.V.P. balloting for the third time in five seasons, but I think that’s where this is headed. He is going to be the first scoring champion (36.1 points per game) to win the scoring title by more than eight points per game since Michael Jordan did over Dominique Wilkins in 1986-87. And I tend to agree with Houston Coach Mike D’Antoni’s contention that Harden is the only player capable of hauling the injury-riddled Rockets to 53 victories out of the 11-14 hole they were in. Harden simply has the misfortune of doing all that damage in a season that belonged to Antetokounmpo and the Bucks.It feels as though I have been writing and tweeting about Doncic and his Atlanta Hawks counterpart Trae Young all season. I suspect I will be writing about the two of them for the next decade-plus. And I’m fine with that.Doncic has had the start-to-finish stronger campaign and continued to look like a franchise player even though the Mavericks steadily increased his Year 1 workload after trading away four-fifths of their starting lineup in February. The trade brought in Kristaps Porzingis and better positions Dallas to build out a supporting cast tailored to their electric European import.Young has delivered even more impressive post-All-Star break production (24.9 points per game and 9.1 assists per game) for a scrappy Hawks team with a passable record of 23-29 since its dismal 6-23 start — and an increasingly bright future.Doncic is going to win the race, but Young overcame his own worrisome launch to make it a competition — and a rivalry that should have staying power — with his second-half surge.Doncic will be remembered as the only rookie in N.B.A. history not named Oscar Robertson to average at least 20 points, 7 rebounds and 5 assists. And Young can take solace in being almost as unfortunate as Harden if he doesn’t win the hardware. It’s quite a compliment when you think about it.Had the Indiana Pacers won 50 games in a season in which Victor Oladipo was healthy enough to play only 36, Nate McMillan would have the résumé to deny the Bucks’ Budenholzer. I’m not sure McMillan is miles off with 47 wins.Doc Rivers of the Los Angeles Clippers, like McMillan, is another victim of bad timing. Rivers hasn’t had a team overachieve like these starless Clippers since his rookie season on the bench with Orlando in 1999-2000 when the Magic won a wholly unexpected 41 games in a season billed as a placeholder before a splashy free-agent summer that ultimately landed Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady in the Magic Kingdom.But Milwaukee’s improvement in Budenholzer’s first season has been so dramatic that I can’t see how he doesn’t win his second Coach of the Year trophy. Perhaps some voters will try to convince themselves that the Bucks would be getting too much love if they vote for both Giannis for M.V.P. and Bud for this honor. But we’re talking about the league’s only 60-win team … and the runaway champions in average point differential for the season (+9.1) … and the only team in the league to rank in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency."
Basketball,"LOS ANGELES — Here’s an underrated perk of being Chadwick Boseman. One day, you’re out on a date at a jazz concert with your lady. It’s at one of those pastoral Californian sites: summertime, dragonflies. The sun is setting, pink and orange and spectacular, rivaled in charm only by the swell of the music, which is as shimmering and soulful as the surface of a lake.It’s a near perfect moment. Perfect, that is, except for the view. A couple of yards ahead, partly obstructing your sightline, you notice a man with far-too-low jeans and AWOL underwear. A man whose fleshy hind-cleavage is putting on an impromptu show of its own.If you were anyone else, you might crack a joke (ahem), avert your gaze and hope for the best. A funny footnote on an otherwise scrapbook evening.But you’re Chadwick Boseman. One of the most bankable actors of your generation. Conjurer of heroic icons real and imagined, a ludicrous personal pantheon that so far includes Jackie Robinson (“42,” 2013), James Brown (“Get On Up,” 2014), Thurgood Marshall (“Marshall,” 2017) and, His Majesty of Wakanda himself, Black Panther.Which is to say that you’ve learned a thing or two about what leadership looks like, about how to embody courage. And so you exchange a glance with your lady and mutually aghast row-mates, consult your repertoire of Great Men like some metaphysical Rolodex, walk up to the fellow with the exposed crack and initiate the following exchange in the very same impersonation of the Godfather of Soul that this newspaper’s reviewer called “bone-deep.”Chadwick Boseman, as James Brown: Are you enjoying the show?Man With Exposed Crack: Yeah!Boseman/Brown: Good. Because we’re trying to enjoy it, too. Only we can’t do it because we’re lookin’ at the crack of yo’ ass.Pile of Ashes Formerly Constituting Man With Exposed Crack: [Hissing sounds.]This really happened, mostly.“Someone had to tell him!” Boseman said in an interview recently, not quite defending himself.He was laughing and pounding the table in a Western-chic restaurant with adobe brick, exposed beams and soaring skylights. It was the laugh of a benevolent conqueror, or of a man who landed the Robinson role within two years of moving to Los Angeles — both rows of teeth, steady eye contact.“He had no idea who I was,” Boseman said, noting that the encounter had been a couple of years ago, before he’d personified this year’s most in-demand new Halloween costume. Then, somehow, he capped his story with an observation that was both sophisticated and gracious.“That’s a gift that the characters give you,” he said. “A dimension of yourself that you never had before.”[ Want help deciding what to stream on Netflix and Amazon Prime?

Basketball,"For the past couple of weeks in Current Events Conversation, we’ve been challenging students to talk to each other in the comments sections of our writing prompts.This week, we want to point out a few of the unique benefits they get from interacting with each other in our online forum — and, of course, highlight student examples of each.Global perspectivesStudents get the chance to interact with people from all over the world in our comments section. These interactions might offer them a new perspective on a topic or challenge them to think differently.This week, we saw many students from Taipei, Taiwan responding to American students on our prompt “Have You Ever Felt Like an Outsider?” For example, Astrid Hagen, Avy, Regina Wu, Sarahlin, Kristen and Chen Yu Ping all related their experiences of feeling like outsiders at their school to those of teenagers halfway across the world in North Carolina, Alabama and New Jersey.Civil conversationsAll of the comments that appear on our site are moderated by Learning Network editors. This gives students a unique opportunity to engage in civil conversations around tough topics.This week, we saw respectful back-and-forth in a thread on our prompt “What Is Hard About Being a Boy?” from Will Mason from Hoggard High School, Sabrina Mintz from Masterman, Philadelphia, Hope A from Masterman, Philly, Lily Sklaver from J.R Masterman School, Philadelphia, Samuel Hamilton from Masterman and Nico M. from J.R Masterman School, Philadelphia.And we loved to see many other students from J.R. Masterman School, like Anna Praticò, G Jap, Sivan Frankel, Tino K. and Ian Birley, pushing back on and agreeing with specific points made by their fellow commenters.ValidationBy replying to and recommending each other’s comments, students get validation for their ideas, feelings and experiences from their peers. Hsun from Taiwan, Hanna Sh from J.R. Masterman, Philadelphia, PA, and Kristina Kitsul from Masterman Philadelphia are just a few of the students who gave that kind of affirmation to others this week.Keep up the great work, everyone! We look forward to the conversations we get to read and call out next week.Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear as they were originally submitted.__________In his Op-Ed, “It’s Dangerous to Be a Boy,” Michael C. Reichert writes about the unique challenges boys face, like violence against themselves and others. Their tendency toward aggression isn’t necessarily innate, he writes, but “rooted in boys’ socialization, which is characterized by physical discipline, control and disdain for weakness.”"
Basketball,"ON A MID-DECEMBER morning at her home studio, which is perched on a wooded hill near Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, Calif., the 98-year-old dance artist Anna Halprin was leading a movement class. “Think about positive and negative space,” she said, observing from a director’s chair as her 12 students — a retired preschool teacher, a fine-linens importer — assumed a range of positions at once ordinary and not. One woman began to crawl through the parted legs of another, as if a child at recess, while a third communed with the wall, splaying her limbs against its rust-colored surface. Warmed up, the class then made its way to the adjacent 1,800-square-foot redwood deck that Halprin’s late husband, the landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, built in 1952. Since its construction, artistic heirs of Halprin, including Simone Forti, Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown and Meredith Monk, have visited the deck at one time or another to practice and move with her. An esteemed teacher and performer, Halprin is known for her use of scores, or task-based improvisations, as well as for making dances inspired by nature. Once outside, a pair of students inspected some overhead branches and then offered full-body impressions of leaves rustling in the wind.It’s difficult to see the beginning of things, and this is especially true of artistic movements, which tend to bleed together at their edges. And yet Halprin’s deck is considered one of several birthplaces of what would come to be called postmodern dance — an experimental school that posed formal questions about just what dance could be — which otherwise originated in New York in the early 1960s. Its 20 or so most active and influential practitioners were mostly trained dancers working on the fringes of the dance-world establishment and their visual artist peers, all of whom recognized that one of the things dance could be was a type of conceptual or performance art, other then-burgeoning and medium-blurring movements that regarded the three-dimensional body as a Duchampian ready-made. Together, this group retooled the common dance vocabulary and redefined who might be seen as a dancer, which inevitably had implications beyond the realm of composition, upending assumptions about beauty and bodies at a time not unlike our own.[Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.]While stylistically divergent, postmodern dance tended to reject virtuosic movements in favor of pedestrian ones like walking, crouching, flailing and falling — take Rainer’s 1963 piece “We Shall Run,” in which the dancers made good on their word. It also embraced humor and a Dadaist sense of the absurd, as evidenced by Lucinda Childs’s “Carnation” (1964), in which the artist placed a colander on her head and a stack of fanned dishwashing sponges in her mouth, or David Gordon’s singing of “Second Hand Rose” and “Get Married, Shirley” during the first performance of his finger-wiggling “Mannequin Dance” (1962), which he conceived of while in his bathtub. “‘Swan Lake’ it ain’t,” the New York Times weekly arts columnist Grace Glueck reported overhearing at the First New York Theater Rally in 1965, which featured a dance work by the artist Robert Rauschenberg combining live turtles, saltine crackers and a campy tap routine by the dancer Deborah Hay.Until then, thinking about dance had been, as Gordon once lamented, “peculiarly conservative,” with performative Western dance history unfolding rather apart from the other arts and consisting largely of ballet (which had been twirling in place since the 1600s until its neo-Classical offshoot was developed by George Balanchine) and modern (which the experimentalists felt was overly and falsely expressive). The postmodern movement wasn’t exactly a strident dismissal of all that had come before: “I think there was a question of, ‘Why do these people take ballet if they’re just carrying mattresses around?’ But I felt it was important for dancers to have a certain discipline,” says Childs. Discipline, however, did not mean favoring what was considered a dancerly body, with long legs and good turnout. Postmodern choreographers placed trained and untrained dancers — as well as more- and less-toned ones — side by side, dispensing with the makeup and organizational structure of formal companies so as to privilege the mind and movements of the individual. In deconstructing dance, then, they managed to democratize it.“We’re still feeling the reverberations of that moment,” says the New York-based choreographer Pam Tanowitz, who might be described as a contemporary postmodernist. In a way, in fact, we’re feeling them as much as ever. Postmodern dance developed alongside both artistic and social upheavals, particularly second-wave feminism and, though it was not often expressly political about things other than aesthetics — “there wasn’t a specific agenda,” says Childs — the style’s early champions, many of whom were women, were seeking alternative ways of moving through space and, by extension, life. Their work is a reminder, as we live through our own reckoning surrounding the control and mistreatment of women’s bodies, of the ongoing validity of that search.PART OF POSTMODERN dance’s power lay in the fact that, for all of its foreignness, it was also familiar. Here were movements taken from the street or home and performed by able but merely human bodies in intimate settings — namely at downtown galleries, lofts or the freewheeling Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, either in the main sanctuary or upon the painted lines of the basement basketball court. As in life, gestures often lacked musical accompaniment: The dancers took many cues from the composer John Cage — most famous for his composition “4’33”,” in which no music is played for the duration of the title, the only noises coming from the environment surrounding the performance — and from Cage’s partner, the choreographer Merce Cunningham, who applied the same theories of indeterminacy found in Cage’s music to movement. Cunningham, who would have turned 100 this year, would sometimes flip a coin to decide the next move, giving his work a nonlinear, collagelike quality.These were ideas simultaneously being explored in visual art, which was engaged in a similar resetting of boundaries as Pop, Minimalism and conceptual art replaced Abstract Expressionism, with which modern dance was closely aligned; for one, both were preoccupied with working on the floor, as in the paintings of Jackson Pollock and the dances of Martha Graham. Postmodernists remained keen on gravity, however. Certain choreographers would come to treat the floor as a dance partner, just as multidisciplinary artists like Ana Mendieta and Bruce Nauman used it in their performance pieces as a site for symbolic regeneration or heady writhing. (“Once, after seeing me perform, my father said, ‘Well, that was very nice, but now that you’re in your 40s, perhaps you should think about standing up,’” says Forti.) In 1960 and 1961, first at the Reuben Gallery in the East Village and then again at Yoko Ono’s Chambers Street loft, Forti showed “Dance Constructions,” featuring a choreography centered around a series of physical structures (a slanted board, a hanging rope), which she created after coming across pictures of the Japanese performance artist Saburo Murakami bursting through a row of paper screens. In one of her constructions, an abstracted portrait of a domestic drama, Rainer and the artist Robert Morris, Forti’s then husband, bobbed up and down from opposite ends of a wooden seesaw. Forti considered her work as much dance as sculpture, its human performers art objects like any other — but it hardly mattered, since, for this brief and exceptional window, art, dance and music were almost synonymous.If postmodern dance’s acceptance as visual art was fueled by the form’s sheer conceptualism, it was helped along by its genre-hopping participants. The 1960s New York art scene was famously small, and disciplines blended together as a result. In addition to Rauschenberg and Morris, visual artists best known as painters and sculptors such as Alex Hay, Carolee Schneemann, Red Grooms and Andy Warhol were all part of the greater Judson scene. “Bob [Rauschenberg] was with [the dancer] Steve Paxton and I was with Alex and for a while we were a little foursome,” says Deborah Hay. “Bob liked to cook for people, so we’d go to his place for steak or lobster and then we’d all go dancing at Max’s Kansas City.” As the dance artist Ralph Lemon puts it, “The fact that these people were sleeping together doesn’t get talked about enough,” adding that the exchange between art and dance at that time must have been “visceral.”Lemon came up in the late 1970s, when the new new dance was infusing postmodern constructions with overt social commentary, and was greatly influenced by what he calls dance’s “lineage of white women.” It’s true that the downtown scene at that time included few artists of color — uptown, Alvin Ailey was leading his own dance revolution — and it’s also true that, simply because they’d always been there, women in dance held power not necessarily afforded to those in other artistic realms. “We all learned the same movement,” says Rainer. “By the mid-60s I was having women lift men.” Ana Janevski, a curator of the Museum of Modern Art’s recent exhibition “Judson Dance Theater: The Work Is Never Done,” believes Judson’s esprit de corps had a “proto-feminist” bent. “This was essentially a group of women working together democratically and mining their own lives for material,” she says. For Rauschenberg’s turtle piece, Brown danced in her wedding dress.In time, though, the moment of equilibrium passed and the community collapsed, reality itself acting as a sort of score. After the last Judson dance concert in 1964, Childs taught elementary school for five years to support herself before returning to the field. Rainer’s return, following a long career making experimental films, came much later, in 2000. Forti lived for a time in Rome, crossing paths with the Arte Povera movement, and Deborah Hay eventually landed in Austin, where she hosted group workshops. Even in the ’60s, says Hay, when visual artists and dancers were intensely collaborative, they were still split over the matter of finances: It was the visual artists who had money. That gap only widened as contemporary art became ever more expensive, and by the 1980s, art institutions had little incentive to invest in something as inherently ephemeral and thus nearly impossible to own as performance. Around this time, Childs professionalized by starting her own dance company and moved increasingly afield from the visual arts community, performing on more traditional proscenium stages. The work, though, remained radical. At one of the early showings of Childs’s seminal “Dance” (1979), the technically simple leaps and phrases of which create complicated floor patterns that evoke the line drawings of Sol LeWitt, one of Childs’s collaborators on the piece, a disgruntled viewer threw eggs.THOSE YEARS HELPED us to understand the body not just as a tool for making art but as a battleground. Deborah Hay talks about finding her own language for movement in the post-Judson years and about practice as protest: “I’ve been choreographed as a woman. I’ve been choreographed as an older woman. I’ve been choreographed as a liberal. I’ve been choreographed as a Jew. I’ve been choreographed as a single woman. I’ve been choreographed as a mother,” she says. “When I dance, I try to enlarge that choreography.” At 77, she still spends every morning in the studio. Eventually, though, so-called ordinary movement becomes less so. One of the things that does separate a dancer’s work from a painter’s, say, is that it must change along with her body. Rainer, now 84, has incorporated text into her recent work and given herself the role of reader. Childs, 78, mostly choreographs for others these days, but she danced her 1973 work “Particular Reel” as part of MoMA’s Judson exhibition this past fall, her measured gestures still assured and her presence still potent. It is a striking thing to see her and her contemporaries onstage or merely moving across a room (as Forti did during our interview to retrieve a poem she’d written that week), knowing we may not have much longer with these witnesses to and architects of an extraordinary time. “They’re here,” says Lemon. “Right in front of us. They’ve placed these bodies with minimal physical information left to give, and in that requisite reduction is something profound.”“This is sort of the last chance to get it all down,” Tanowitz says of recent attempts by contemporary companies and art institutions, from MoMA to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, which have acquired pieces by dancers like Brown and Monk for their collections, to preserve early postmodernist contributions by reconstructing scores and restaging works. (Brown died in 2017, but her company lives on, still holding rehearsals in her loft at 541 Broadway.) Younger artists have also taken on the responsibility of preservation and recontextualization. In 2017, the artist Adam Pendleton made a video portrait of Rainer that alternates between footage from 1978 of her dancing her minimalist-leaning “Trio A” sequence and present-day scenes of her reading found text accounting the deaths of black Americans including Eric Garner and Tamir Rice. In this revisiting, Rainer’s quick and careful steps become pleas for space in which bodies can move freely, unrestricted by race, gender or immigration status.Halprin, who early on saw dance as a social corrective and pathway to personal healing, creating community-based work with the arts organization Studio Watts Workshop after the Watts riots of 1965 and with people with AIDS in the ’80s, is also attuned to the more minor injustices of modern life. “That one’s a graphic designer,” she said to me of one of the students in her California studio. “When else does he get a chance to connect to his spirit? He doesn’t.” Most of these women are hesitant to describe dancing — and theirs in particular — as spiritual, but, if one has dismissed a technique-based approach whereby one dances to become better at dancing, an alternative objective, it was abundantly clear on the dance deck, is joy. How encouraging that this joy might be available to anyone willing to look for it. At the end of class, the students gathered on the deck around Halprin, who was wrapped in a wool blanket-coat she wore as a dance student in the Midwest in the 1930s, as she described seeing a rendition of her 1965 work “Parades and Changes,” in which a group of dancers slowly undress, performed at San Francisco’s de Young Museum last October. “My 9-year-old great-granddaughter was there and has taken to telling her father, ‘You see, Dad, ordinary movement can become art. You just have to do it with awareness.’”"

Golf,"As the polar vortex bore down on the United States a couple of weeks ago, we left our home in New York via an ice-encrusted front door. We were lucky enough to have tickets to Bonaire, a little island in the Caribbean Sea. Seven hours later, including a layover at Miami International Airport, the plane landed on a sunny, flat field rimmed with pipe organ cactuses and scraggly shrubs. Bonaire looks like Arizona, except for the azure waters in the distance. It also happens to be showing the rest of the world just how to save coral.Bonaire is a true desert island. Tiny and crescent shaped, it is south of the hurricane belt, but right in the path of the trade winds, almost constant breezes from the east that push off rain. The same winds brought the first Dutch colonists and their slaves on sailing ships to this island in the 17th century. Their descendants still speak a unique Creole language, Papiamento, the vernacular of all native Bonaireans.In a dying reef world, tiny Bonaire, pop. 19,405, is a success story, mainly thanks to the relative paucity of people, which has kept development at a minimum. Its reefs are also thriving because of a 40-year-old marine maintenance system, and a coral reef restoration effort, both of which are models for the rest of the Caribbean.I grew up far from oceans in the Midwest. My husband, Erik, introduced me to snorkeling 20 years ago on a reef off the coast of Florida, after a reporting trip to Haiti. It was a kind of miracle. Weightless in salt water, breathing through a plastic tube, we were immersed in flashing yellows, silvers, reds and periwinkles, the colors of fish living in an alien landscape of brain and branched and fan corals. I was hooked. We later snorkeled on trips whenever we were by the sea, including the Red Sea, the Great Barrier Reef and even with sea lions in the Sea of Cortez.A few years ago, I returned to the Florida reef of that first snorkel and found it transformed into a ghostly white underwater calcium graveyard of dead coral bones. Hurricanes, overdevelopment and warming seas have devastated coral reefs around Florida, inducing a condition called coral bleaching. After that, I paid more attention to headlines about dying coral reefs and I assumed I’d never see a live reef again. Then a diver friend tipped us to Bonaire.Our first morning on the island, eyes half-blinded like moles by the equatorial sunlight, we followed Ebby Jules, a muscular local dive master with two decades of reef experience, to his truck, dented from a recent fender bender on the island’s narrow roads. (Goats and the feral descendants of Nubian donkeys brought over by the colonialists are charming but significant traffic hazards, along with scooters and tourists on golf carts.) He steered us to our first snorkel spot across from the glittering pink and white salt “pans,” shallow lagoons of evaporating seawater once worked by slaves in brutal conditions, and now operated by the American agri-giant Cargill.“Do you want to see a bait ball?” he asked. We shrugged. Still on New York time, half awake, whatever it was sounded like a plan.He pointed out into the sea, at a dark spot about 30 yards offshore. Hoping it wasn’t the kind of bait that attracted sharks (which, it turns out, are rare on the Bonaire reef) we donned our masks, followed him over to the prickly coral shoreline, avoiding black spots of spiny sea urchins emerging and disappearing in the surf, and pitched ourselves into the water.We paddled weightless on the surface as the water deepened to about 30 feet, and the white sand below disappeared into a navy void. Suddenly it was around us: hundreds of thousands of silvery fishes splitting into two great aisles, and reforming, moving as one, weaving parabolas up, down and under, millions of scales glinting sunlight. The effect was breathtaking, like being sucked into a tunnel of stars, or time traveling through the universe.We lingered transfixed for 45 minutes until we felt cold and then clambered out. Back on the terrestrial plane, we were clumsy and felt our weight again and the itchy drying of the salt on our skin. We were hooked.This is your brain on reef: Floating in warm salt water, colorful fish flitting in and out of view, the occasional sea turtle swimming up to have a look at you above a gold and yellow and green and white sea floor of corals slowly swaying. Weightless and warm, body evaporates and the mind becomes conscious of intimations of universal interconnectedness. The experience is as profoundly relaxing and peaceful as one can find without taking a pill or a shamanic herbal tea.This natural wonder was born three to four million years ago, when the Greater Caribbean became isolated from the Pacific Ocean after the closing of the Isthmus of Panama. It has since developed its own unique reef life, with about 65 species of hard corals and some 500 to 700 species of fish. Many of them are thriving along much of the 226 miles of Bonaire coastline, and can be experienced by anyone with a mask and fins.Maps of the island show it rimmed with 62 numbered dive and snorkel sites, marked on the roadside with yellow painted rocks, with names like Andrea 1 and Andrea 2, Tori’s Reef and Jeannie’s Glory. Many sites are named after the various girlfriends of “Captain” Don Stewart, a California sailing hippie and party animal who wanted to be a pirate in the Caribbean and washed upon Bonaire in 1962 with a leaky boat. Mr. Stewart, who died on Bonaire a few years ago at the age of 94, was a self-taught diver who liked to hunt with a spear gun, until he repented killing and became an early evangelist for reef maintenance and restoration.Mr. Stewart gets credit for dreaming up what became the Caribbean’s first and oldest marine park, Stinapa, which 40 years ago instituted rules limiting fishermen and divers. Among them: No more spearfishing. No more anchors. They built underwater moors for boats to tie up on. And each of the divers who come to Bonaire must take a one-day orientation course where they are reminded of a set of strict rules, not to trample corals, not to wear gloves or chemical sunscreen, to touch nothing, and never to drop anchor on the reef."

Golf,"On May 10, 2017, less than 24 hours after President Trump fired James Comey as F.B.I. director, Comey received an email from a man he had never met. The correspondent, Matt Latimer, began by praising Comey’s “decades of faithful service to the United States government and to the cause of law and order” and offering sympathy for the “tumultuous period” he was going through. Then Latimer got to the heart of the matter. As the head of a Washington literary agency called Javelin, he wanted Comey to know that if he ever had any interest in writing a book — “and we’d urge you to consider the possibility” — he wanted Comey as a client.“Javelin is prepared to invest in you and your story,” Latimer wrote. “It’s the least we can do for someone who has given so much to our country.”Comey did not want to write a book. He sent Latimer a polite response saying as much. But several months later, he began to warm to the idea, and he thought back on his correspondence with Latimer. “There was something about the tone of his email,” Comey recently told me. “I just liked the tone.”Latimer and Keith Urbahn, Latimer’s partner at Javelin, went to lunch with Comey at his golf club. “Their pitch was, ‘We will be your partner in a way that’s unusual for the literary-agency business,’ ” Comey recalled. Before they were literary agents, Latimer and Urbahn were Republican operatives, and they viewed a book project as akin to a political campaign. They told Comey that they would not only work with him on a proposal and shop it to publishers; they would also help him with the writing, social media presence, publicity and what they called the “messaging” of the whole project. They promised to offer “brutal feedback” at all times. “One of the big challenges in any place, but especially in Washington, is getting people to tell you the unvarnished truth, especially if you stink,” Comey said. “I knew I could count on these guys to tell me when I sucked.”Comey had come around to the idea of writing a book because he wanted, he said, “to be useful in the wake of something bad happening and to make something good come of it.” He envisioned not a memoir but a leadership book, reflecting on the lessons he had learned in the course of his long career. What he did not want to write was anything about his 109 tumultuous days as Trump’s F.B.I. director. “I was desperate not to be a ‘Trump book’ writer,” he told me.Latimer and Urbahn gave him the brutal feedback that it was too late for that. “We convinced him that if you come out with a book that doesn’t deal with the thing that people most want to know about you — what the hell happened in the rooms where you were one on one with Trump — you’re going to be leaving major questions unanswered, and people will be unsatisfied,” Urbahn said. “And you’re going to be asked about them anyway.” They sold Comey on the idea of a “story-driven” book about his career, including his experiences with Trump — in other words, a memoir — that essentially tricked people into learning the leadership lessons he hoped to convey. “Their logic was strong,” Comey said.Comey insisted on writing the book himself, forgoing a ghostwriter, but he leaned heavily on Latimer and Urbahn for editorial assistance. The drafts he sent them would come back “all slashed up,” Comey recalled. “They had a vision that I just didn’t have.” They also possessed an understanding of the political media landscape that Comey, and even his publisher, lacked. “We knew the minute the book came out there were going to be people criticizing him that he didn’t go far enough,” Latimer said. “He didn’t say Trump was a Russian agent. There’s no news here. Blah blah blah. So we wanted to set the book out on our terms — early.”Last March, a month before the book’s publication date, Latimer and Urbahn had Comey tweet at Trump: “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon.” They hosted get-to-know-you meetings between Comey and the news anchors vying for his first interview and negotiated with their networks for prime-time slots. They briefed reporters, on background, about the book’s newsiest bits.When it finally arrived in bookstores, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership” did indeed tell of the lessons in “ethical leadership” that Comey learned while rolling up the Gambino crime family and prosecuting Martha Stewart. But it was the book’s final 90 pages that received all the attention. Comey offered dramatic, blow-by-blow accounts of the F.B.I. investigation into Russia’s efforts to help Trump in the 2016 campaign and his hair-raising interactions with Trump after the election. “Before we had even reached publication day,” Urbahn said, “we had sold about a half million copies.”One morning in February, I went to see Latimer and Urbahn at their office, which sits on the second floor of a 19th-century rowhouse in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Va. A steady snowfall obscured the usual view of the Potomac River from the office window. Latimer, who is 48, and Urbahn, who is 35, were dressed for the weather, in khakis and duck boots, like a couple of prep-school English teachers. Their work space has the feel of a cozy reading room, with lots of exposed brick and shelves crammed with books (along with the occasional bottle of bourbon). Posters of their clients’ book jackets decorate the walls. Most of them are typical Washington fare: a campaign biography by Ted Cruz, a book about Nancy Reagan by her former press secretary, the reportage and essays of political journalists and pundits.Since “A Higher Loyalty” was published, the townhouse had become a popular destination for Trump administration officials, especially those contemplating an exit — “and they all are, by the way,” Urbahn told me. “They’re all planning to get out.” Latimer chimed in. “We’ve met with or talked to probably every major official you would know who has departed or is thinking of departing the Trump White House,” he said.[Read more: secretary of state Mike Pompeo, one of the last remaining memebers of Trump’s original White House team.]The problem for these officials is that many of the White House exits have been nailed shut. The path from the executive branch into highly remunerative private-sector work — the standard post-administration trajectory, for better or worse, in recent decades — used to be smooth, as Barack Obama’s press secretary Jay Carney (now at Amazon) or George W. Bush’s communications director Dan Bartlett (Walmart) can attest. While veterans of Trump’s State and Treasury Departments have tended to navigate this path successfully enough, some people who have worked in other, more controversial precincts of Trump World have had a hard time even getting job interviews. “If it’s a publicly traded company, the C.E.O. doesn’t just have to worry about blowback from shareholders if they hire someone from this administration,” one former senior Trump administration official, who requested anonymity to discuss the travails of some of his friends and colleagues, told me. “They have to be concerned about how their employees are going to react. If the company has offices in Silicon Valley or New York or Los Angeles or D.C., it’s a hard play.”Latimer and Urbahn have turned this professional abyss into their market niche. Their central insight is that that hoary old fixture of Washington self-promotion, the tell-all, may be the ideal solution to the very new problem of post-Trump rehabilitation. A juicy memoir not only stands to earn a former Trump official a small fortune, thanks to an unprecedented interest in administration intrigue. It also gives officials an opportunity to reposition and redeem themselves. “A lot of them are trying to figure out: How do I make something out of this for my own well-being?” Latimer told me. “But also: How do I distance myself from this guy?”After the two helped Comey land a book advance just shy of $3 million in 2017, Urbahn said, “people whose entire job has been basically to undermine Comey came to us asking us to think through what their next steps are.” Last year, he and Latimer secured the former White House aide Cliff Sims a seven-figure deal for his book about his Trump experience, “Team of Vipers,” which was published in January. Now rarely a week goes by that Latimer and Urbahn don’t hear from someone in the administration."
Basketball,"PARKLAND, Fla. — The name “Parkland” has become a shorthand for the tragedy that many hoped would mark the beginning of the end of school massacres.But ask the survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in more quiet moments about the awful year since last Feb. 14, and they tell you a different, more personal story. About innocence lost. Dreams undone. Grief delayed.There’s the boy who took five bullets to protect his classmates. A hero, the headlines proclaimed. He wanted to be a professional soccer player. “Now I don’t do anything,” he said.There’s the young woman who tells people about her best friend, because if she calls him her boyfriend, it doesn’t seem sufficient to convey what they were. Soul mate: That’s what he’d told her she was to him. Told her before he died. And there are the famous faces, the students everyone thinks they know, who on a recent morning stood at a nearby elementary school where a local charity quietly unveiled a mural, the last of 17 community service projects created to honor each of the victims. David Hogg, the one who went on CNN and dared adults to act like one, lay on a basketball court and painted in a hibiscus flower. Emma González, the one who “called B.S.” on politicians who weren’t serious about gun control, crouched barefoot before the wall, cut out a paper stencil and sang along to the Beatles’ song, “Here Comes The Sun.”To think of them, and of this upscale suburban high school, as mere symbols of tragedy ignores the complicated tapestry of sadness, fear and defiance that is now forever part of it — and will be long after the last of these students graduate.[Read about the young lives lost since Parkland and where gun control and school safety stand today.]In a series of interviews, nine members of the Stoneman Douglas community — students, parents, police, teachers — reflected on the past 12 months.They did not want to relive that day.

Basketball,"Sure, CBD is everywhere. But it hit the Sundance Film Festival with full force only in January, when Charlotte’s Web, a leading purveyor of the substance — the Uber of CBD, if you will — hosted a three-day party, lines out the door, in a converted store and restaurant on Main Street in Park City, Utah.It was envisioned by the seven brothers behind the company: Josh (43), Joel (39), Jesse (37), Jon (36), Jordan (34), Jared (32) and J. Austin (27), all with the last name Stanley. Five of them were attending Sundance with their proud mother, Kristi Stanley Fontenot, 65, hosting screenwriters, film editors and the like dressed in casual sweaters, jeans and snow boots, at panel discussions on the future of cannabis and alternative healing and at parties serving CBD-infused cocktails.One night there was a $175 10-course dinner. All the dishes, including the cured black cod to the hazelnut chocolate crunch cake, contained Charlotte’s Web CBD. Thomas Pierce, a 32-year-old film producer and C.E.O. of an entertainment marketing agency, was among those bingeing on the offerings. “I attended a private dinner for 50, a happy hour event with CBD beer and tacos, and a late party sipping on delicious CBD cocktails,” Mr. Pierce said. “I was in my happy place.”Josh Hetzler, a producer of “Before You Know It,” a film premiering at Sundance, worked with Charlotte’s Web to distribute CBD to his entire cast and crew. The brothers were running around the space, letting their personalities shine.Josh Stanley, the eldest and nerdy one, roped guests into technical, scientific discussions about CBD. “We use liquid chromatography to test all the levels of the cannabinoids in the field,” he told this reporter. “We perfected the art of the oxymoron. The whole plant is standardized.” (A 30-something woman nearby was overheard telling her friend that he looked like the lead singer of a boy band.)Joel Stanley, the chairman of the company, ran around handing out necklaces that carried bottles of their farms’ soil and taking selfies. He slicked his hair back for the occasion and proudly wore a fluffy gray-and-white-checkered wool sweater. “My brother bought them for all of us in Mexico City,” he told a group congregated around him. “I don’t know why my brothers aren’t wearing theirs.”J. Austin, the youngest, was there with his boyfriend, Mitch Clough. (They live together in Denver and have a dog named Little Arthur Weasley.) He kept coming up to his mother, hugging her and making fun of her for how much she was loving Sundance. “He’s the fun one,” she said.Jon, the bearded one (though he has shaved since), mostly hung out at a table with his fiancée, Katie, holding hands and savoring the food. And at a party later Jared was drinking cocktails with his mother at a wooden table at the back, shyly surveying the scene.While their personalities differ, they all agreed on one thing: They hated the larger-than-life banner of all seven of them posing on the hemp farm hanging on the wall of the party.“I think most of us are intimidated by it,” Josh said. “We tried to take it down. We can’t handle it.”“I think we are a marketer’s dream because we have a family dynamic,” Joel said. “They feel like we’re a great big sandbox. We’re, like, O.K. …”“It’s kind of crazy,” J. Austin said. “I’m the wallpaper for a Sundance party.”There were more guests at the party than in the brothers’ entire hometown."
Basketball,"We invited high school students to submit a letter on any recent Times article. Popular topics included why high school doesn’t have to be boring, leggings, plastic bags, beauty, the college admissions scandal, asking kids what they want to be when they grow up, the murder of an Uber customer, basketball’s “one and done” rule and social media/technology/video games.

To the Editor:Re “A Breaking Point for Stretchy Pants?” (Thursday Styles, April 4):“Every girl in this classroom is wearing pants!” observed my Honors English 10 teacher, contrasting today’s gender roles with those of Jacobean England. When Shakespeare wrote “Macbeth,” this was unheard-of. In 21st-century New Jersey, leggings are the norm.Maryann White, the mother who wrote a letter to a school newspaper, asserts that women should refrain from wearing you’re-asking-for-it leggings so that men can better control their primal impulses. We should avoid our favorite garment for the “greater good.” We must censor our wardrobes to help men practice self-control.Wait, what?I thought that in the epic battle for women’s equality, sometime between the 19th Amendment and #MeToo, the question of women wearing pants had been asked and answered. Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines pants as “an outer garment covering each leg separately and usually extending from the waist to the ankle.” It’s not complicated. Leggings are pants. If men have impulse-control issues, that’s not our problem.We women of Gen Z have bigger dragons to slay. Look for us pushing boundaries — seeking parity in pay and congressional representation. Look for us in the C-suites and on Capitol Hill. We’ll be the ones wearing the leggings.Elizabeth Hirschfeld, Mountain Lakes, N.J.Mountain Lakes High School, 10th gradeTo the Editor:Re “Someone Is Always Trying to Kill You,” by Sonia Nazario (Sunday Review, April 7):I was born and raised in El Salvador, where domestic violence, rape and murder became normal for women. I grew up with the fear of never seeing my grandmother when she went out to do errands. My grandmother told my siblings and me about being nearly killed by my alcoholic grandfather.Sadly, my mom and my aunts were beaten by my grandfather when he got home drunk because they complained about not having enough food after he had spent all the money on alcohol. I heard about other girls my age being raped and left in places where no one could find them. When I was 12, my family moved to America, seeking a safer and better life. Luckily, I found it. But when thinking about where I stand today and where other girls and women are in Central America, I feel angry at myself, as I am safe while there is a girl out there taking her last breath.Many families are running away because it is their only option. They are just looking to live without being hunted like animals."

Basketball,"On cold mornings, Les Goodson shows up early outside the University Club, on a wealthy stretch of Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and races two panhandlers he has nicknamed Catman and Pimp-the-Baby for a warm spot in front of a steam vent. He launches into “Take Five” on his saxophone, leaving his case open for bills and coins.In a good week, it’s a living — enough to pay the rent on his railroad flat in Harlem and put food on the table. A few times, he has seen a former classmate, Gregory Peterson, bound into the social club without so much as a nod.Mr. Goodson, 67, and his classmate were among a record number of black students admitted to Columbia University in 1969. Columbia and other competitive colleges had already begun changing the racial makeup of their campuses as the civil rights movement gained ground, but the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, and the resulting student strikes and urban uprisings, prompted them to redouble their efforts.They acted partly out of a moral imperative, but also out of fear that the fabric of society was being torn apart by racial conflict. They took chances on promising black students from poor neighborhoods they had long ignored, in addition to black students groomed by boarding schools.A look back through the decades shows what went right in the early years of affirmative action in college admissions, but also what can go wrong even with the best of intentions.Those who were able, through luck or experience or hard work, to adapt to the culture of institutions that had long been pillars of the white establishment succeeded by most conventional measures. Others could not break through because of personal trauma, family troubles, financial issues, culture shock — the kind of problems felt by many white students as well, but compounded by being in such a tiny minority. And universities at the time, they said, did not have the will or the knowledge to help.“I think it’s a fair question to ask: Did we really understand or know what we were doing, or could we have predicted what the issues would be?” said Robert L. Kirkpatrick Jr., who at the time was dean of admissions at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., which was part of these early efforts. “The answer is no. I think we were instinctively trying to do the right thing.”Columbia — an Ivy League campus right next to Harlem — was a particularly revelatory setting. Perhaps nowhere else were the divisions more striking between the privilege inside university gates and the troubles and demands of black people outside them.The New York Times tracked down many of the nearly 50 black students in Columbia’s Class of 1973, who arrived on campus as freshmen in 1969. Some of them have remained close friends and helped locate others from directories and photographs.The number of black students admitted to Columbia more than doubled in 1969 from the year before. About half of those who enrolled received their degrees four years later. Many, like Mr. Peterson, went on to comfortable lives and professional success. His classmate, Eric H. Holder Jr., rose from a strivers’ neighborhood in Queens to become the first black attorney general of the United States. There were future doctors in the class, future executives and lawyers. Others, like Mr. Goodson, strayed from prescribed paths.The debate over race in college admissions only intensified. By the late 1970s, colleges began emphasizing the value of diversity on campus over the case for racial reparations. Today, Harvard and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are facing legal challenges to race-conscious admissions that could reach the Supreme Court. The Trump administration is investigating allegations of discrimination against Asian-American applicants at Harvard and Yale. University officials who lived through the history fear that the gains of the last 50 years could be rolled back.One of them is Lee Bollinger, the current president of Columbia, who first arrived on campus as a law student in 1968.“In that time, there was a sense, pure and simple, that universities had to do their part to help integrate higher education,” Mr. Bollinger said. “We are still on that mission, but the sense of purpose and urgency and connection to the past have dissipated.”"
Basketball,"Every week, we ask at least a few questions in our writing prompts that invite students to write about their personal experiences, like whether they love to dance, what foods they think represent their hometowns, and how they feel about gym class. We love reading the responses to these questions because every one is as different as the teenager who wrote it.This week comments on two such prompts — “What Is the Most Memorable Thing You Have Ever Lost or Found?” and “Your Food Obsession” — really stood out to us.What made these comments pop? For one, the writing was full of descriptive words, sensory details and colorful language that made us feel like we were there. We also enjoyed how many students turned their experiences into stories, complete with suspense, action and a lesson learned. And, we can never resist those comments that make us feel something, whether it’s laughter, fear, heartbreak, joy or secondhand embarrassment.Read on to see for yourself what students wrote, as well as their opinions on our most popular prompt of the week about whether college athletes should get paid.Thank you to the new classes who joined us from all over the world: Orange, Calif.; San Jose, Calif.; Southern Delaware School of the Arts; St. Elizabeth Elementary School; Switzerland; Towanda, Penn.; Western Washington; and Saigon South International School in Vietnam.Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted.__________A red crayon, smashed into the pavement. A child’s glove, perfectly framed by sidewalk cracks. Spilled French fries. A key on a chain. These are some of the items photographed by Sara Barrett on the streets of New York City for her piece, “A Mitten, a Key, a Unicorn: Did You Drop Something?” Inspired by her photographs, we asked students about the precious and memorable items they have lost and found.They told us about jewelry, toys, money, pets and valuables. We loved reading about the strange and the sentimental alike, but what we like most about these responses is that each one is like a short story about finding the beauty, tragedy and mystery in ordinary moments.The most interesting — and weirdest — things we’ve foundI can’t really remember what I was doing, but I think I was digging the garden to plant some saplings. But while I was digging, I found a rock with a sharp edge. I was curious about it so I held on to it and after class, I went to the bathroom and washed away the dirt on it. There, I noticed that it was black and shiny.At first I didn’t know what it was, but I thought it was obsidian. I wasn’t sure, so I took it to my science teacher and asked what it was. And I was right! It was obsidian. It was shiny, and had very cool sharp edges. I was fascinated!— John B, SSIS, HCMC, VietnamOne day I was taking boxes of old stuff outside because my family was have a garage sale. As you know garage sales are boring and last hours so my I thought I would pass the time looking through boxes. As I did I found this green stuffed bunny, at first I thought nothing of it but then it was like I was in the back of the head by my old memories. I was suddenly taken to back to when I was a little girl and I was carrying around that exact bunny. I was reminded or very mundane memories which were forgotten over time. But it was crazy how one look at the stuffed bunny and I was shot back into my own past like looking through a picture book that has been put away on the shelf for many years. I not only found the bunny, but the bunny helped me find my memories as well. I guess you could say I found two things that day.— Wiio Meinheit, Hoggard High school, NC"
Basketball,"Duke, Virginia and North Carolina — three No. 1 seeds from the Atlantic Coast Conference — opened the N.C.A.A. tournament with victories on Friday, but not before each one survived a scare. Virginia may have received the biggest shock: a year after it became the first No. 1 seed to lose its opening game in the men’s tournament, it had to rally from a halftime deficit to defeat Gardner-Webb, 71-56. Duke, the tournament’s top overall seed, fell behind No. 16 North Dakota State in the first half, but a burst led by the star freshman Zion Williamson (25 points) shook the Bison loose, and the Blue Devils cruised to an 85-62 win. “In the second half, we played beautiful basketball,” Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said.North Carolina, like Virginia, also trailed at halftime, but clawed its way back and won going away, 88-73.Other lower seeds had more luck: No. 10 Iowa, No. 11 Ohio State, the No. 12s Oregon and Liberty, and one No. 13 — U.C. Irvine — were among the double-digit seeds to win on Friday.North Carolina overcame its first-half struggles to advance against Iona, ensuring there would be no repeat of a No. 16-vs.-No. 1 upset this year.The Tar Heels, the Midwest Region’s No. 1 seed, trailed by five at halftime against Iona before dominating the second half to earn a trip to Sunday’s second round to face ninth-seeded Washington.U.N.C. was the last of the four No. 1 seeds to complete play. Gonzaga won easily in Thursday’s first round.Cameron Johnson had 21 points while the freshman Nassir Little had 19 off the bench for North Carolina, which shot 63 percent after halftime. Iona also cooled off, making just 5 of 20 3-pointers in the second half after going 10 of 21 in the first half.Ohio State went from barely making the N.C.A.A. tournament to a spot in the second round with an upset of sixth-seeded Iowa State. Kaleb Wesson had 21 points and 12 rebounds to lead the 11th-seeded Buckeyes (20-14).Keyshawn Woods added 19 points for Ohio State, which will play No. 3 seed Houston on Sunday.Iowa State (23-12) led only once in the second half but had a chance to send the game into overtime when Nick Weiler-Babb had an open attempt at a game-tying 3. His shot missed and ended the season for the Cyclones, who won the Big 12 tournament to earn their spot in the N.C.A.A.s.Ohio State’s win improved the Big Ten’s record to 7-1 in the first round; only Wisconsin lost, to Oregon.After three double-digit seeds won to open the day in San Jose, Calif., Virginia Tech brought some sanity to the site. The fourth-seeded Hokies raced out to a fast start and led No. 13 seed Saint Louis 40-18 at the half. "
Basketball,"I was impressed by how long Tarell Alvin McCraney was willing to sit in silence until I asked him something. When I first met him, on the campus of Yale University, where he is chairman of the playwriting program — one of the most exclusive in the country, admitting only three students each year — it struck me that he was, if not distant, then at the very least aloof. Small talk was made and pleasantries exchanged, but I couldn’t help noticing that there was not much eye contact. At first I attributed this to normal self-consciousness, but as the day progressed it occurred to me that it might be a kind of honesty: He wouldn’t do me or himself the disrespect of offering a charm performance. He simply said it was nice to meet me and suggested we get a bite at a nearby Cuban restaurant. Once there, he looked over the menu for not long at all before ordering the eggplant steak and then, as if on impulse, an empanada de guayaba and a cafe con leche. He would drink the coffee but would have the empanada boxed up to share, he said, with his students.Then came the silence. It seemed that he might have sat there all day had I let him, quietly content, thinking about various plays, or current events, or music, or film. Instead, I started to explain how much the film “Moonlight” — based on a script McCraney wrote in his early 20s, for which he would ultimately win an Oscar — meant to me. I told him that I grew up in circumstances that allowed me to relate to its central character. And it was here that McCraney began asking the questions, leaning slightly forward over the table, regarding me with patient but curious eyes: Where were my people from, what was their world like, how did my father fit in if at all, which plays did I perform in during high school, what did my mother think of my performances? He was a near balance of observer and observed, 60 percent admirer, 40 percent work of art.There were details he would recall and bring up long after this meeting. Three weeks later, he would make a joke that showed he remembered my birthday. This is normally the stuff of politicians — a parlor trick of remembering details, of making others feel as if they have your care and attention. But with McCraney it does not feel performative. He has a way of understanding and respecting the stories of anyone he chooses: my story, the stories of the characters in his scripts and plays, the stories of the graduate students he spends his days teaching. He asks questions that draw you into relief against your background and show you not only your own beauty but also his. This, it seems, is one of the ways he has learned to navigate a treacherous world and stay intact, or as intact as a queer black man can be in America.The McCraney Literary Universe is a large one: He is 38 and has seen eight plays produced, written two screenplays, won a MacArthur genius grant and adapted Shakespeare for the Royal Shakespeare Company in London. (When I asked what made him like theater when he first encountered it, he replied: “I don’t necessarily know if I like it now” — but “the drive to do it is innate.”) If you want to write about this universe, you must be comfortable using the word “beautiful.” In McCraney’s work, the beauty of blackness is a praxis unto itself, the method by which larger theories about life are made manifest. The full, original title of the screenplay that became “Moonlight” was “In the Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue.” The film, which won the Best Picture Oscar in 2017, wasn’t just about the beauty of its characters but about the way they fight a losing battle against that beauty — how they try to beat it out of themselves and one another. The central conflict is that of a character trying to find harmony between who he is and who he is expected to be, a struggle that is, for many black men, not a theoretical matter but a violent, corporeal one.The same ideas recur in “Choir Boy,” the queer coming-of-age tale that marked McCraney’s Broadway debut when it opened at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater in early January. This story, too, sits amid one of the primary contradictions of black American maleness: To be black and fully realized is to be beautiful. But to be beautiful is to be wanted, which, in America, is to be unsafe.McCraney was raised in a working-class family in Liberty City, a five-square-mile section of northwest Miami that is home to one of the largest black populations in Florida. His mother struggled with drug addiction for the entirety of his upbringing, ultimately succumbing to AIDS-related conditions when McCraney was 22. His future collaborator Barry Jenkins, who directed “Moonlight,” was just a year older, raised just a few miles away, also by a mother struggling with addiction.[Read Angela Flournoy’s profile of Barry Jenkins, the director of “Moonlight.”]From the beginning, McCraney says, he was obsessed with telling stories. He credits his grandfather, who was a Baptist minister, for deepening his understanding of the spiritual power of narrative. Growing up alongside immigrants from Haiti and Cuba also meant McCraney was exposed to the Orishas, the pantheon of gods in the Yoruba religion, a West African theology that has found expression in the Caribbean and across the African diaspora. The stories of the Orishas, like those of the Greek gods, comprise a veritable soap opera of betrayals, heartbreaks, love affairs and tragic flaws. Their influence on McCraney was meaningful enough that he would one day write a trilogy of dramas, “The Brother/Sister Plays,” based on Orisha stories.McCraney’s academic potential was recognized early. In middle school, he found himself tracked into a magnet program that let him focus on literature and performing arts. Thus began a long stretch of working in spaces where McCraney was either the only black person present or one of very few — an experience that strikes him as something of a doubtful advantage. “You’re told, ‘You’ve got this special gift, this thing that will cure you of your blackness,’ ” he says. “But then they use that same information to castigate and diminish your people. So now you’re alone and can’t relate to nobody. So what do you actually win?”As a teenager, he became politically active through street theater, working on community plays designed to raise awareness of H.I.V. testing and education. He carried this political view of theater to DePaul University in Chicago. It was in Chicago, in the early 2000s, that he auditioned for a show by the director and playwright Tina Landau, of Steppenwolf Theater, who would become his most frequent collaborator: By her count, they’ve done 12 productions together since they first met. “He was just this beautiful, startling young man with lots of depth and mystery,” she says. Years later, when he approached her to direct one of his plays, she was struck by the power of his writing. His stories, she says, “on the one hand, have not been told — because the details, the specifics, are so of his real life and the lives of his characters — and at the same time they operate on this very fundamental — what’s the word I’m looking for — on an ur level.”After DePaul, McCraney took a year off, during which he traveled to Georgia to bury his mother and worked briefly in Miami theater. Then he took his talents to Yale, as a student in the same graduate playwriting program he now oversees. Part of his application was an early version of the script for “Moonlight,” a largely autobiographical story written around the time of his mother’s death. It was the overwhelming intensity of his emotions at the time, he thinks, that created the heightened poetry of the film. He was unlikely, he told me, to write anything quite like that in the future. “I was 23 when I wrote that. I don’t want to be 23 again. I don’t want to be in that much pain ever again.”If beauty is the pillar at one end of his work, pain is at the other. McCraney digs unflinchingly into the suffering that pulses at the center of his character’s lives. I asked him about the concern some black artists and storytellers have — that our work may simply boil down to trading in black pain for rent money. “If the question, for you, about peddling black pain is appropriate,” he replied, “you also have to think to yourself, well, why am I in so much pain?” It doesn’t make sense, he suggested, to demand that an artist produce joy when his or her inner life is still processing grief. He then talked about the rapper Lil Wayne, who famously suffered a gunshot wound at age 12. For years, he said the gun had gone off by accident; only last year did he reveal that the childhood wound was from a suicide attempt. “He talks about the time that he shot himself because it still haunts him,” McCraney said. “He woke up in a pool of blood. He’s, like, engaged in that, and going through it. Why is it important for us to be like, ‘Hey, get over that. Where are the dandelions?’ ”It was not long after McCraney’s graduation from Yale that he mounted his first production at Steppenwolf, became the group’s 43rd member and wrote and directed work for the Public Theater, Center Theater Group and the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he directed interpretations of “Hamlet” and “Antony and Cleopatra.” “The only thing that kept me going,” he told me of that time, thinking of the second play, “was: I’ve got to bring this play back to the little Haitian girls who live across the street from me, who have never seen themselves as royalty.” Around this time, Barry Jenkins came across “Moonlight” and asked McCraney for permission to rework it into a shooting script, prompting McCraney’s first foray into feature film. Steven Soderbergh’s film of McCraney’s second feature, a basketball drama titled “High Flying Bird,” is scheduled for Netflix release in February — and in addition to the Broadway run of “Choir Boy,” the Oprah-led OWN network has ordered a season of McCraney’s first television project, the semi-autobiographical “David Makes Man,” currently filming in Orlando.Allison Davis, a writer on “David Makes Man,” remembers walking into the writers’ room with some nervousness. “He could have thrown his ego around that room, and it would have been justified,” she told me by phone from Los Angeles. Instead, she was disarmed when McCraney suggested the staff begin by taking an online quiz to determine which Harry Potter house each person would belong to. “Then we started talking about what all the houses represented, and then we started talking about what in our backgrounds made us answer the way we did, and it became this very deep discussion about language and trauma and influences, and we were talking about this for like three hours.”This ability to merge the mundane with the profound, to draw complex emotions out of many different people and sources, is a hallmark of McCraney’s work. “ ‘David Makes Man’ pulls from so many references,” Davis said. “The Bible is up in there, Yoruba is up in there, Miami street culture is up in there, ball culture is up in there. He weaves it into this wonderful tapestry, and he treats them all with equal reverence.”"
Basketball,"Many of our writing prompts ask students to respond to breaking news, like the newest Marvel movie, the vaccination debate, or the recent college admissions cheating scandal. But many others ask about more evergreen topics, like whether children need recess and what it’s like to be left out. Since our writing prompts are open for comment indefinitely, students can chime in on topics like these at any time.In fact, we’d like to give a shout out to students from Lakewood High School in Ohio and Homewood High School in Alabama, both new to our site this week, who have been writing excellent comments on our prompts from this week and weeks past. We love having new classes add their voices to the ongoing conversation on our site.Thank you to all the other new classes who joined us this week: Congress Middle School; Hawthorne Math and Science Academy; Kirkwood, Mo.; Louisiana; Maples Met School; Nipher Middle School; Ridgeview Middle School, Visalia, Calif.; Suffern High School; The Galloway School, Atlanta, Ga.; and Walla Walla High School, Walla Walla, Wash.And welcome back to loyal commenters from: Danvers, Mass.; Hoggard High School; Julia Reynolds Masterman Laboratory and Demonstration School; and Providence, R.I. We never get tired of reading what you have to say. Keep up the great work, everyone!Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear as they were originally submitted.__________On its opening day on March 8, “Captain Marvel,” starring Brie Larson, became the first film in the Marvel movie franchise to focus principally on a woman. In light of this historic moment, we wanted to know: Does the gender of a superhero matter? Do we need more female superheroes?We asked students and they responded with mixed reactions. An overwhelming majority said, yes, equitable gender representation can have profound societal and personal impacts. But others argued that the Marvel Universe is a business, “not an activist group.” Still others said we have more important things to worry about than what gender our superheroes are.Representation matters — we need more female superheroes!Do we need more female superheros? Yes, yes and YES!! Representation is essential in all forms of media. While I’d like to say that I don’t factor in things like gender or race when I look at a character, I do notice those things. It’s nice when a character looks like me, or has similar problems. You connect more to a character when they remind you of yourself.— Ashley Anderson, Hoggard High School, NCIt’s been proven that without roles for others to look up to, many won’t go against the tide; a rule that can be spoken for the same aspects of race and sexuality. Seeing people like us in a position of power, success, wealth helps us to dream, to learn. Without female superheroes, girls wouldn’t be encouraged to empower themselves or fellow women. They wouldn’t want to become the superheroes of our society: the lawyers, the police women, the fire women, the doctors. When you don’t see people that are like you - struggling, flawed, anti-heroic - it’s difficult to accept who you are, to love yourself for who you are. Female superheroes give girls, boys, and everyone in between the knowledge that you can be whoever or whatever you wish.— Alexandria, Lakewood, OH… When boys and girls see superhero movies portraying both powerful men and women, they develop more of a notion that men and women have equal roles in society. This allows them to believe that one group does not dominate over the other; rather, men and women can work with each other to better the society in which we live. Marvel superhero movies are one step in developing an understanding of women as resilient, courageous, and positive role models for the general public and for young children and teenagers. According to Dave Itzkoff, the essential change that is beginning to include both genders is “slow but it’s happening.” Through their recent addition of more women who share qualities of brave leaders, Marvel is helping to create a society where men and women are both seen as superheroes."
Basketball,"Across the armed services, women made up 16 percent of the active-duty military as of 2017 — by branch, that number ranged from 8.4 percent within the Marine Corps to nearly 20 percent within the Air Force. Their representation is small and growing only marginally — in 2007, women in uniform made up 14.4 percent of the force — and their stories tend to be ignored in favor of legacies left by men who have shaped the narrative of service to country. Despite being overlooked, servicewomen are forging new career paths for themselves and the next generation as they enter jobs that were once closed to them. Consider pioneers like Capt. Rosemary Mariner, who was one of the first female Navy pilots in the 1970s and the first woman to lead a naval aviation squadron. She died in January from ovarian cancer, and her memory was honored last month with a flyover using all-female pilots. Or First Lt. Marina A. Hierl, who in 2018 became the first woman in the Marine Corps to command an infantry platoon.[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.]For International Women’s Day, The Times asked servicewomen and veterans to send us the stories that defined their experiences in the military. We left it to them whether to share their accomplishments, the challenges they faced or something unforgettable from their time in the military. Below is a selection of the more than 650 submissions we received.I am a jet engine mechanic on the F/A-18F Super Hornet. Not many women or men will ever get the opportunity to do what I do. It’s been tough at times throughout my career to have men tell me they will not work for me because I’m a woman. I say to them: “That’s O.K. You don’t have to follow me, but I will bring you along.” When I was stationed in Germany, I was part of a group that wanted to use a recreation center to hold meetings for Wiccans. My letter to the editor, printed in Stars and Stripes, began a journey in which I became a representative for witches’ rights in the military. I still have my dog tags, which indicate my religion as Wiccan. I decided to enlist during the Vietnam War. My cousins, who were also my close friends, were being drafted and volunteering for other branches to avoid the Army draft. I was afraid that they would not return. So I decided that if they were going, I was going too. In 2006, a male shipmate got into my barracks room and placed a camera in my bathroom and set it to record. I found it only after getting out of the shower. I took the camera to my male chief, whom I had known for only about a month. He assured me that he would get to the bottom of it. By lunchtime, the strange looks from everyone became obvious. Another shipmate told me that everyone in the company office had passed the camera around and saw the video of me naked, getting into and out of the shower. I come from a Hispanic family and am the only woman in my family to have joined the Army. I didn’t tell them I was enlisting until the day I left. I was very young and was afraid they would try to talk me out of enlisting. I know I deeply hurt them, but thankfully, they’ve since come to support my decision. As some have said, if we put on our flight boots, we were often becoming a “first” at something. I was the first female Navy pilot to instruct in the T-44 Pegasus trainer for the advanced maritime prop pipeline. I was one of the first female instructors in the EC-130 aircraft for “Take Charge and Move Out” squadrons. I was also among the first mission commanders and maintenance check pilots. I was among the first female aviation assignment officers. I was the first female naval aviator to be promoted to the rank of one-star and then two-star admiral in the Navy. I was the first woman to command the Navy’s Warfare Development Command.I am currently Mrs. Texas Galaxy. When I was a National Guard recruiter, I came across many young women who said they couldn’t join because they were too “girlie.” So I started to compete in beauty pageants again to prove that you can still be and feel beautiful and follow any career path you want.In 2004, I had orders to be stationed on the U.S.S. Fitzgerald, which at the time was stationed in San Diego. When my ship finally pulled in, I found out I was the first female enlisted sailor to ever be stationed onboard. They didn’t even have a place for me to sleep.[For more stories about the experiences and costs of war, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.]I have served for 16 years in the National Guard, Reserves and on active duty, and I have become accustomed to being the only person in the room who looks like me. My greatest accomplishment was taking command and deploying over 125 troops into combat and bringing them all home safely to their loved ones. I don’t think there is anything that will ever compare to that. In early 2002, I deployed to Afghanistan with the 21st Military Police Company (Airborne). The infantry was facing issues running combat patrols because the local women were hiding intelligence, weapons and high-value targets. It would have been cultural warfare for the male infantrymen to search these women. They needed a “high-speed female” to go on combat patrols and missions with them — and I was selected. My unit treated me no differently because I was a woman. I was referred to as “Hall.” I was a leader, a paratrooper and I smoked the hell out of some of those men.In 2015, I assisted with the integration of women into Ranger School for the first time in history. These efforts helped to change the combat exclusion ban on women in direct ground combat and ushered in the opening of all positions for women in the armed forces. My job was very controversial. I was part of a group of servicewomen attached to the three phases of Ranger School and walked the lanes with the Ranger students. Three women completed the course, and I personally got to watch one of them ace her leadership patrol and lead the pack like it was second nature."
Basketball,"Last week, we challenged students to engage with their fellow commenters on our writing prompts — to ask questions, respectfully disagree with each other, add on to one another’s thoughts or recommend their favorite comments. And, boy, did they deliver.Here are just a few of the stimulating conversations we saw:• On “How Important Is Knowing a Foreign Language?,” Drew from MN, Alex from mn and Paige F from Bryant HS, AR agreed with other students about the importance of speaking multiple languages and shared their own experiences.• Sebastian Zagler from John T Hoggard High School Wilmington NC and Julia Fede from J R Masterman [Philadelphia, PA] debated the merits of the Electoral College with other commenters on “Should the U.S. Get Rid of the Electoral College?”• Kakada Av from Bryant High School Arkansas and Noah from white bear lake commiserated with other teenagers about their work habits on “Are You a Procrastinator?”• So many students replied to to each other’s comments on “Do You Like School?” that we don’t have room to list each individual here. But, we want to give a special shout out to the many students from Holicong Middle School and Julia R. Masterman School who started up conversations with students from other schools.• And, dozens of commenters received “Reader Picks” designations from their peers’ recommendations across all our prompts.Excellent work, everyone!Our challenge this week? Keep the conversation going. If someone replies to you, read what they wrote and respond. We’ll call out more great student writing next week.Finally, welcome to new classes from: Boca Raton, Fla. and Mountain Ridge Middle School, Colo.Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear as they were originally submitted.__________“When you ask American teenagers to pick a single word to describe how they feel in school, the most common choice is ‘bored,’” Jal Mehta and Sarah Fine write in their Op-Ed “High School Doesn’t Have to Be Boring.” In our related Student Opinion question, we asked students if they felt the same way.Their answer? A resounding “yes.” Below, they tell us why they often find school so dull, explain the things that make it fun and give plenty of suggestions for how to make their classes more engaging,School is boring."
Basketball,
Basketball,"Manuel Gomez, a private investigator who used to be a cop, lives and works alone in a one-bedroom apartment above a laundromat in the Bronx. His living room is strewn with paperwork from his cases — police reports, witness statements, a photograph of a young woman with a razor wound across her face. Reproductions of famous paintings, including nudes by Picasso and Modigliani, line the walls. “The Lament for Icarus,” a 19th-century British piece, depicts the fallen Greek cradled by weeping nymphs. “What this picture reminds me,” he told me, “is that it’s better to die for something than to live for nothing.” When I pointed out that the Icarus myth was perhaps more widely understood as a parable about the dangers of hubris, he shrugged. “To hell with that [expletive]. I say, Fly right past the sun. I always push the envelope.”Over the last few years, Gomez has made a name for himself investigating the cases of people who claim to have been charged with crimes they didn’t commit. He says he offers his services only to people who are truly innocent — something the former Army intelligence officer insists he can suss out within moments of meeting someone. “I learned to pick up on their tell signs,” he said. “Their idiosyncrasies.”Most of Gomez’s clients come from the South Bronx, the poorest congressional district in the United States. The area has a high crime rate and a heavy police presence. Gomez, who once worked the same streets when he was a cop, is among a number of current and former members of the N.Y.P.D. who contend that the department pressures officers to meet arrest quotas in low-income black and brown communities, and that this pressure drives them to arrest people for trivial offenses and, in some cases, for crimes they didn’t commit. (The department has long denied this practice and in recent years has vowed to sanction supervisors who continue to enforce quotas.)As a private investigator, Gomez looks for cases that seem to reveal police wrongdoing. He has cultivated relationships with local television reporters and often appears on their shows to denounce cops and prosecutors. He thrives on the attention. At 51, he’s built like a safe, strong and square, and he dresses like the detectives he grew up watching on TV, in shiny shoes, double-breasted pinstripe suits and shirts with his initials stitched into the cuffs. At times he talks like a hard-boiled action hero. “I see myself as a punisher for the wicked and a bringer of justice to the innocent,” he told me. “I protect the weak.”In the low-income communities where Gomez operates, people who have been wrongfully arrested face enormous obstacles in proving their innocence. One reason is the sheer volume of arrests in these neighborhoods. In New York City, where the arrest rate has begun to decline after soaring for decades, there are still more than 250,000 arrests prosecuted per year. The city’s courts, meanwhile, employ only enough judges and court staff to take about 650 of those cases all the way to trials with a verdict. With hundreds of thousands of cases to dispose of, prosecutors often try to pressure defendants to plead guilty, typically pursuing lesser charges if they agree to take a plea. Not everyone who succumbs to this pressure has committed a crime. For defendants who can’t afford bail, just getting out of jail can be reason enough to take a plea. “There are people pleading guilty every day in that courthouse to things they didn’t do,” says Marty Goldberg, a lawyer with decades of experience as both a prosecutor and a defense attorney in the Bronx.In many cases, defendants have only minutes to confer with their overworked public defenders and can only guess at what evidence the prosecution might have against them. New York is one of several states with what is known as a blindfold law, which allows prosecutors to withhold crucial evidence from defendants until their trials are about to begin. Prosecutors say these laws protect witnesses from retaliation, but critics challenge their fairness and constitutionality. “You can’t see the police paperwork, sometimes you don’t even know the names of your accusers,” says Justine Olderman, executive director of the Bronx Defenders. “You’re in the dark. Coupled with the bail system and pretrial detention, you can understand why people would be desperate for someone like Manny.”Gomez doesn’t just gather evidence for his clients the way an ordinary investigator might. A trial is in many ways a contest in which each side seeks to bolster its own credibility while undermining that of the other. But because so few criminal cases actually go to trial, defendants seldom get the opportunity to challenge the credibility of the officers who arrested them, the detectives who investigated them or the witnesses who accused them of committing a crime. Gomez does all of that on his clients’ behalf — not in the courthouse but in the court of public opinion. His aim, in every case, is to pressure prosecutors into conceding defeat before they can persuade the defendant to take a plea. “I jam the evidence so far down their throat,” he told me, “that they have to say ‘dismissed.’ ”He investigated his first wrongful arrest in 2014, a murder case in which a young Dominican immigrant named Enger Javier spent two years in jail awaiting trial. Gomez found surveillance videos that proved Javier was not involved in the stabbing; the district attorney dismissed the charges, and Gomez’s client sued the city for wrongful imprisonment, receiving an $800,000 settlement. Since this first case, he says, he has investigated dozens of others. In a number of high-profile cases, his clients had their charges dismissed or won settlements from the city. Gomez says he often allows his clients to defer payment until they receive settlement money. His clients speak warmly of him. One man who had spent months in jail told me Gomez brought him clothes and books after he was released. “He treats people the right way,” he said.But as I followed Gomez over the course of a year and a half and multiple investigations, watching him attack the credibility of cops and prosecutors in New York, it became clear that Gomez had credibility issues of his own. His single-mindedness, though clearly an asset to his clients, could also be a liability. He could be rash to the point of recklessness. He had a history of aggression and violence. And he sometimes overlooked facts that didn’t conform to his preconceived ideas of justice and injustice. Some cases his clients have brought against the city and the police have been dismissed with prejudice by the courts. Goldberg told me that even if his clients were out of options, he’d advise against hiring Gomez. “I am loath to believe anything the man says,” he told me.Gomez insisted to me that he had never done anything unethical during an investigation, but he acknowledged that he “walked the edge” between what was permissible and what was not. “The ends justify the means,” he told me, summing up the wisdom he gleaned from Machiavelli’s “The Prince.” “Whatever I got to do,” he said, “I’m going to do it.”In the summer of 2016, Gomez took on what would become the biggest case of his career. He claimed that a ring of corrupt cops in the 42nd Precinct of the South Bronx was terrorizing an entire neighborhood, forcing kids to implicate one another in crimes, as part of a scheme he described as a “gargantuan nightmare of corruption.” At the center of the case was a teenager named Pedro Hernandez. Over the next 14 months, Gomez brought widespread attention to Hernandez’s story in the New York press, transforming the then 16-year-old into a cause célèbre. To Hernandez’s supporters, from Kerry Kennedy to the prominent activist Shaun King, his ordeal illustrated the most egregious failings and inequities of the system. In a long essay on Medium, King declared that Hernandez’s saga was “the most painful, traumatic, outrageous, outlandish, over-the-top story of government-sanctioned police brutality, wrongful convictions” and “widespread corruption” in “modern American history.”When Hernandez’s troubles started, he was living with his mother, Jessica Perez, and three siblings in the Morrisania section of the Bronx, a hilly neighborhood scattered with massive public housing complexes. As of 2015, Morrisania accounted for a higher percentage of the city’s jail population than any other neighborhood in New York. Hernandez’s older brother, Jesswill, was in jail, facing a murder charge for which he would later be convicted. Hernandez had been having his own run-ins with the law. Starting when he was 15, he had been arrested multiple times for a series of shootings and robberies, among other less serious offenses, and had spent time in a juvenile detention facility. But all his criminal charges were eventually dropped.As Hernandez and Perez would later repeat in court filings, they claimed he had been unjustly targeted and framed by a group of cops at the 42nd Precinct, among them a detective named David Terrell, who specialized in gang investigations. Perez told me she first met Terrell a few years earlier, when her sons began having problems with the authorities, and since then she had had a series of disturbing exchanges with him. On one occasion, she told me, Terrell called her at home and asked her to bring some “Spanish food” to the precinct. On another, she said, he drove up alongside her and her mother and ominously said he would “break into” her before laughing and driving away. Perez said she eventually “put him on zero,” admonishing him in front of another officer to leave her alone. After that, she said, she began seeing Terrell in the lobby of her building, talking to her neighbors in what she felt was an attempt to work up some bogus justification for arresting Hernandez. (In a continuing lawsuit, Terrell asserts that he never had any “personal involvement” with Perez, and his lawyer called the accusations “laughable”; a lawsuit Perez and Hernandez filed against Terrell, other officers, the City of New York and a district attorney was dismissed. Hernandez has since filed a new lawsuit.)In July 2016, Hernandez was charged in connection with another shooting and was sent to Rikers Island, where New Yorkers who can’t afford bail are typically jailed while awaiting trial. In the past, Hernandez’s family had been able to pool together enough money to bail him out. This time, the prosecutor, claiming that Hernandez was a violent gang member and a “scammer” with access to large amounts of cash, asked the judge to set the bail high enough to keep him inside. The judge obliged, settling on $250,000 — an unusually high sum for even a violent crime. On her next visit to Rikers, Perez had to tell her son that she couldn’t afford to bring him home. “That was the day that he first told me, ‘I can’t be in jail, this is making me feel like I want to die,’ ” she told me. “I came home, and I had two options. Have the same feelings with him — he wants to die, I want to die, too. Or get mad about it and do something about it.”Perez called Gomez, whom she had seen on television. Gomez says he was initially skeptical when Perez told him her son’s story. Would rogue cops really conspire to arrest the same kid again and again for crimes he didn’t commit? “It was too outrageous,” he said. “Too out there.” But after meeting Hernandez, Gomez was convinced of his innocence. “He didn’t have that street look, like a thug or criminal,” he told me. “He was just very family-oriented. You could see that. You could feel it.” Hernandez told me that he was “not a saint,” but he added, “I wasn’t the worst kid outside in the streets either,” and he insisted that he hadn’t committed any of the crimes for which he was charged."
Basketball,
Basketball,"At sunrise, there it was: a red-tailed hawk, its gyre widening over the United States Capitol building in the Creamsicle-colored light, like the world’s least subtle literary reference. It was still there by midafternoon, drifting on the thermals over the mostly depopulated National Mall, wheeling occasionally past the window in the hallway outside the office where the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, sat on the 20th day of what would soon become the longest government shutdown in American history.That morning, Jan. 10, Washington’s principal chaos agent, the president of the United States, had given a typically accusatory and free-associative news conference on the White House lawn, reiterating his demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the Mexican border and his intention to continue the shutdown without it. Then he decamped to the border for some photo ops with Customs and Border Protection officials. Republican senators spent the lunch hour shuttling back and forth between Vice President Mike Pence and McConnell, sequestered in different quarters on the Capitol’s second floor. Now the last speeches of the day were being made, the reporters had mostly gone and McConnell sat in his office, reciting an unfamiliar tale: that of his own powerlessness.“I’ve been in the meetings,” McConnell, dressed in a pinstripe suit and a banker collar, said. “It’s just that I don’t have the votes that can consummate the deal.” Those votes could come only at the behest of Trump or the new House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, he insisted — and, McConnell continued, “it seems to me the principals, the only people who can make this deal, as of the moment we’re having this discussion, seem to both think they have a winning hand.”McConnell went through the motions of fully blaming Pelosi, as he did on the Senate floor that morning, displaying a poster with two identical pictures of a Southern border wall, one labeled “PRES. OBAMA” and the other “PRES. TRUMP,” under a legend reading, “WHAT BORDER FENCING DO DEMOCRATS SUPPORT?” But he knew as well as anyone that he had in fact negotiated at least a temporary escape from the looming shutdown with Paul Ryan, then the House speaker, in December, which would have funded the government through February, before “the president, let’s just say, changed his mind,” Ryan told me this month, laughing ruefully. “I spoke to him and tried to get the plan back on track, but that just wasn’t in the cards. And here we are.”Or here McConnell was, at least: marooned in a newly divided Congress, trying hard to stay out of the light. “He’s been very quiet,” Dick Durbin, the Democratic minority whip, who was in recent shutdown-negotiation meetings with McConnell and the Democratic Senate leadership, told me that afternoon, “and has said repeatedly that he’s not going to call any bill that the president doesn’t approve of. And that has basically been the sum and substance of his contribution.”McConnell, who has represented Kentucky in the Senate for 34 years and, as of last June, is the longest-serving Republican leader in Senate history, is one of Washington’s most famously inexpressive creatures. “You’ve got to see the gears turning behind the eyes, because the mouth isn’t moving very much,” Ryan told me. Still, his statements about Trump during the 2016 campaign, as the future president gradually cowed into submission the party to which McConnell had dedicated his entire adult life, managed to simultaneously leave everything and nothing to the imagination. When McConnell endorsed Trump in May 2016, after the last of his plausible challengers collapsed, he did it with a terse written statement in which the gritting of teeth was practically audible: “I have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters,” it read, “and Donald Trump, the presumptive nominee, is now on the verge of clinching that nomination.” Speaking to a reporter from USA Today later that month, the most enthusiastic vision McConnell would allow of a Trump presidency was that it “would be fine.”“It would be hard to find two people by personality, or any inclination, that are more diametrically opposed than the president and Senator McConnell,” says Roy Blunt, the Missouri senator who heads the Senate Republicans’ policy committee. “Senator McConnell, very careful and thoughtful about what he says, deeply studied in the history of the country and how the federal government works. The president would not be offended if he heard somebody say he did not spend his time becoming that well versed in those things.” When I asked Elaine Chao, who is Trump’s secretary of transportation and McConnell’s wife of 26 years, if Trump and McConnell liked each other, she was silent for a full four seconds before replying, “You’ll have to ask the president that, and you’ll have to ask the leader that.” When I did ask McConnell, all he said was, “Yeah, we get along fine.”[6 Takeaways from this Mitch McConnell profile.]All of this made it more remarkable that, by the fall of last year, McConnell had emerged as one of the few unambiguous winners of the Trump presidency to date. When I first spoke with him, this past November, he talked of the preceding two years with a faint air of mystified amusement at his own fortune: as if a minor meteor had streaked through the window of the majority leader’s office, narrowly missing his head before exploding against the two-century-old marble fireplace, and then also turned out to be filled with candy and hundred-dollar bills. “I think even though we’re pretty different in every way you can think of,” he told me, clearing his throat, “we’ve had a good sort of team effort here to accomplish as much as we can.”He was the Trump administration’s indispensable partner in seating two Supreme Court justices and 83 lower-court judges: a generational remaking of the courts that has made McConnell, “in my view, the most consequential majority leader, certainly, in modern history,” says Leonard Leo, the conservative legal activist who serves as executive vice president of the Federalist Society and as an adviser to the Trump administration on the court appointments. Shortly after the midterm elections, McConnell’s longtime adviser J. Scott Jennings described to me how McConnell had “taken on this role as the principal enabler of the Trump agenda,” and he meant it as a compliment. There had been an improbable synergy between the two men: the president who covets power but has little sense or discipline in wielding it, and the legislator who has often seemed to consider the skillful exercise of power an end unto itself.Two and a half months later, however, the bargain McConnell made stood in somewhat bleaker relief. Trump had fired his attorney general, Jeff Sessions. His secretary of defense, James Mattis, had resigned over disagreements with his foreign policy; his chief of staff, John Kelly, was now gone, too. For weeks there had been an accelerating drumbeat of Russia-related guilty pleas and filings from the special prosecutor Robert Mueller.The shutdown distilled the essence of McConnell’s position in Trump’s Washington: a man of institutions and establishments whose own legacy was now tied to that of a president who seems hellbent on burning both to the ground. On Jan. 9, he stood stone-faced alongside Trump in a Senate hallway as the president suggested he would get his wall money by declaring a national emergency. “I don’t think much of that idea,” McConnell told me the following day. “I hope he doesn’t go down that path.” Still, he admitted, “I’m perplexed as to how this ends.”When Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court on Oct. 6, after McConnell played a key role in ushering him through a month of arguments over and investigations into allegations of sexual assault, the scope of the majority leader’s influence on American governance snapped into focus. Before McConnell, the small handful of towering Senate majority leaders left their legacies behind in the legal code. Lyndon Johnson passed the first two modern Civil Rights Acts in 1957 and 1960; Mike Mansfield oversaw the third in 1964, and the construction of Johnson’s Great Society; Howard Baker passed Reagan’s tax overhauls that shaped future debates about financing government. All of these accomplishments contained within them a heroic, idealized image of the Senate itself: a chamber where men and women rose from their centuries-old desks to debate the very idea of America, negotiating their way to laws of sweeping import to the country.McConnell is the first majority leader whose career has been built on the assumption that the Senate that could produce the great legislative works of his predecessors is a thing of the past — a fact that itself owes a great deal to McConnell. As minority and then majority leader during Barack Obama’s presidency, he fashioned himself as the essential impediment to Obama’s vision of a sequel to the Great Society, using tactics that were once the province of Senate factions as a strategic blueprint for the entire Republican caucus.Democrats, under the current minority leader, Chuck Schumer, have tried to use McConnell’s own playbook against him and Trump, but to lesser effect. This is in part because McConnell has expended less time and effort than previous Senate leaders on the legislative process that so bogged down Obama’s agenda and more on the Senate’s comparatively difficult-to-obstruct business of approving executive appointments. The unprecedented number of conservative-approved judicial nominees McConnell has waved through the Senate — a process for which he laid the groundwork before Trump was elected — stands to shift much of the burden of conservative policymaking away from an increasingly paralyzed Senate. In the coming years, battles over voting rights, health care, abortion, regulation and campaign finance, among other areas, are less likely to be decided in Congress than in the nation’s courthouses. In effect, McConnell has become a master of the Senate by figuring out how to route the Republican agenda around it."
